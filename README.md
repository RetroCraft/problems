# Pain and Agony: A Collection of CS/BBA Problems and Exercises

This is an [open archive](https://retrocraft.github.io/problems) of practice problems
from my classes in the Waterloo/Laurier CS/BBA program. Some of them cause quite the pain and agony.
These are published with the belief that they are permitted by relevant faculty,
please [contact me](jahyong@uwaterloo.ca) if they are not and I will take them down.

These were originally published alongside my personal assignments
([link](https://retrocraft.github.io/assignments)),
but I figured it may be helpful to make this open to contributions as well.

Feel free to make a pull request for anything you think would be relevant!
I make a lot of mistakes, after all.

## Contributing

- You _should_ be a student in the relevant class to contribute,
  since you should not otherwise have access to these problems.
- LaTeX macros used in multiple files are placed in `header.tex`
- Formatting is done with `latexindent`. I'm not a huge stickler for indentation.
- PDF files are added to the repository so they may be served by GitHub Pages.
- Since this was forked and redacted (Policy 71!), the commit history is a bit messy. Sorry.
