This is an open archive from my time (and my friends' times)
as Waterloo and Laurier CS/BBA and MATH/BBA students.
If you find it useful and want me to endure more pain,
consider sending me a <s>coffee</s> bubble tea.

Study materials by [Ace](https://ko-fi.com/augustace) are also published before each assessment.

#### BU 288 (F2021) <small>Organizational Behaviour</small>

### Economics

#### ECON 120 (F2020) <small>Introduction to Microeconomics</small>

No "practice", but figured this is a nice place to host my cheat sheets.
They are created on Figma, and the source files are available
[here](https://www.figma.com/file/S33O0LmF0JFWizP911r8Py/ECON-120).

If you just want the sheets, you can get them all at my
[Ko-Fi shop](https://ko-fi.com/s/e3b6a8b0d7)
(which is, as always, pay-what-you-want).
They remain on this [GitHub repository]({{ page.gh }}/ECON120) too.

#### ECON 140 (W2021) <small>Introduction to Macroeconomics</small>

I hastily put together an [equation sheet](./ECON140/ref.html) after lecture on the 4th.
Let me know if there's mistakes.

Cheat sheets are being provided on my pay-what-you-want store.
Set the price based on your marginal propensity to consume cheat sheets.

Versioning is semantic: anything that is wrong/serious bumps the major version,
aesthetic changes bump the minor version.

#### MATH 138 (W2021) <small>Calculus II for Honours Mathematics</small>

A collection of theorems can be found [here](./MATH138/ref.html).

Jimmy has notes for [series](./MATH138/Jimmy05.pdf) and [Taylor series](./MATH138/Jimmy06.pdf).

#### MATH 146 (W1989) <small>Linear Algebra I (Advanced)</small>

I found an old copy of my father's _Linear Algebra, 2nd edition_ by Hoffman and Kunze
from when he was at Waterloo (and had the guts to take 14x courses).
I have no idea if anyone at all would find these useful, but here are
[my solutions so far](./MATH146/HK.pdf).
Note that I use the notation from the book, which might hurt when MATH 136 starts.

#### MATH 239 (F2022) <small>Introduction to Combinatorics</small>

My [lecture notes](./MATH239/notes.pdf) (incomplete and somewhat experimental) are available.
You might be interested in the [source](./MATH239/notes.tex) if you want to use TIKZ for graph theory.

There are also [exercise solutions](./MATH239/exercises.pdf) for the course notes
(using the Part I F2020 and Part II S2018 course notes). Progress:

### Pure Math

#### PMATH 348 (S2023) <small>Fields and Galois Theory</small>

[Lecture notes](./PMATH348/notes.html) by Imaad.
They were originally written in Obsidian (which uses a different Markdown parser),
so they look a little funny after spamming regexes to try and make it GFM-friendly.

### Combinatorics and Optimization

#### CO 485/685 (F2022) <small>Mathematics of Public-Key Cryptography</small>

More [lecture notes](./CO485/notes.pdf) with the caveat that
(1) I am not actually enrolled in the course and just sit in it for fun
and (2) I am missing two levels of prerequisites and do not fully understand the content.

## Mistakes
