This is an open archive of practice problems from the University of Waterloo CS/BBA program.
These are published with the belief that they are permitted by relevant faculty,
please [contact me](mailto:jahyong@uwaterloo.ca) if they are not and I will take them down.

I make no guarantees that these solutions are remotely close to correct.
Frankly, it's more likely that they're wrong.
Please let me know if you find a mistake though!
Or, in the spirit of open source, make a [pull request](https://github.com/RetroCraft/problems/pulls) fixing it.

## Computer Science

### CS 135

I don't implement the full design recipe in exercises, for obvious reasons (I'm lazy).

## Mistakes

Because it's motivating or something, here's a list of all of my mistakes.
Hopefully it makes you feel better about yours.
Thanks to everyone on the list who've helped me make this resource better for everyone :)

### _Errata corrige_

1. **MATH135/EP04/RP04** Messed up basic arithmetic (Roy)
2. **MATH135/EP03/RP09** Rewrote completely incomprehensible proof (Gabriel)
3. **MATH135/EP03/RP05** Proved a _there exists_ statement by exhausting the domain (Angela)
