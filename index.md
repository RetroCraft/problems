This is an open archive from my being a Waterloo and Laurier CS/BBA student.
If you find it useful and want me to endure more pain,
consider sending me a <s>coffee</s> bubble tea.
Minus Stripe/PayPal's 30Â¢ transaction fee, of course.

## About
{:.no_toc}

I make no guarantees that my work is remotely close to correct.
Frankly, it's more likely that it's not.
Please [let me know](#contact) if you find a [mistake](#mistakes) though!
Or, in the spirit of open source, make a [pull request](https://github.com/RetroCraft/problems/pulls) fixing it.

If you want to use my `agony` document class for $$\LaTeX$$,
feel free to [download it](./latex/agony.cls) and look through the macros.
The reference sheets on this site use an [adapted config]({{ page.gh }}/assets/js/mathjax.js) for MathJax.

## Business

Quizlet flashcards are not mine: thank Imaad for them.

### BU 111 (F2020) <small>Introduction to the Business Environment</small>

Flashcards available for [PEST factors](https://quizlet.com/ca/553312795/bu111-final-review-f2020-all-pest-factors-flash-cards/)
and [strategic expansion](https://quizlet.com/ca/553644800/bu111-final-review-f2020-intl-business-strategic-expansion-flash-cards/).

More flashcards for the [first midterm](https://quizlet.com/ca/620706160/bu288-organizational-behaviour-i-midterm-1-flash-cards/).

## Computer Science

### CS 135 (F2020) <small>Designing Functional Programs</small>

I don't implement the full design recipe in exercises, for obvious reasons (I'm lazy).

## Economics

### ECON 120 (F2020) <small>Introduction to Microeconomics</small>

No "practice", but figured this is a nice place to host my cheat sheets.
They are created on Figma, and the source files are available
[here](https://www.figma.com/file/S33O0LmF0JFWizP911r8Py/ECON-120).

If you just want the sheets, you can get them all at my
[Ko-Fi shop](https://ko-fi.com/s/e3b6a8b0d7)
(which is, as always, pay-what-you-want).
They remain on this [GitHub repository]({{ page.gh }}/ECON120) too.

### ECON 140 (W2021) <small>Introduction to Macroeconomics</small>

I hastily put together an [equation sheet](./ECON140/ref.html) after lecture on the 4th.
Let me know if there's mistakes.

Cheat sheets are being provided on my pay-what-you-want store.
Set the price based on your marginal propensity to consume cheat sheets.

Versioning is semantic: anything that is wrong/serious bumps the major version,
aesthetic changes bump the minor version.

### MATH 138 (W2021) <small>Calculus II for Honours Mathematics</small>

A collection of theorems can be found [here](./MATH138/ref.html).

Jimmy has notes for [series](./MATH138/Jimmy05.pdf) and [Taylor series](./MATH138/Jimmy06.pdf).

### MATH 146 (W1989) <small>Linear Algebra I (Advanced)</small>

I found an old copy of my father's _Linear Algebra, 2nd edition_ by Hoffman and Kunze
from when he was at Waterloo (and had the guts to take 14x courses).
I have no idea if anyone at all would find these useful, but here are
[my solutions so far](./MATH146/HK.pdf).
Note that I use the notation from the book, which might hurt when MATH 136 starts.

### CS 245 (F2021) <small>Logic and Computation</small>

My own version of the [reference sheet](./CS245/ref.pdf) is a bit more compact.

## Mistakes

Because it's motivating or something, here's a list of all of my mistakes.
Hopefully it makes you feel better about yours.
Thanks to everyone on the list who've helped me make this resource better for everyone :)

### _Errata corrige_

1. **MATH135/EP04/RP04** Messed up basic arithmetic (Roy)
2. **MATH135/EP03/RP09** Rewrote completely incomprehensible proof (Gabriel)
3. **MATH135/EP03/RP05** Proved a _there exists_ statement by exhausting the domain (Angela)

6. **MATH135/EP08/RP05** Totally forgot a question entirely (Javin)
7. **MATH135/EP11/RP01** Obviously, 2 + 1 = -1 (sooshi)
8. **MATH135/EP10/RP15(b)** Overcomplicated proof when it follows almost immediately from the previous question (sooshi)
9. **ECON120/Final** (v1.0) Deadweight loss of monopoly is between MC and demand, not price and demand (Jimmy Zhan)
10. **ECON120/Final** (v1.1) Wrong colour on tarriff supply and demand curves
11. **ECON140/Test 1** (v1.1) NX curve description under AE curve section, simple multiplier given as A/Y not Y/A (Trisha)
12. **MATH137/PA01/Q01(2)** -4 - 2 = -2 (hyk)
13. **MATH135/EP01/RP02** Replace tuple notation with standard quantifiers
14. **MATH135/EP02/WE01** Duplicated truth table
15. **MATH135/EP01/RP02** Questions changed
16. **MATH135/MT2020W/Q02** Question copied wrong
17. **MATH135/MT2018F/Q05** Negated implication wrong ([#7](https://github.com/RetroCraft/problems/issues/7))
18. **MATH135/EP08/RP09** Applied CRT without checking pairwise coprimeness
19. **MATH135/EP06/RP01(b)** Mistyped number (joseph)
20. **MATH135/EP06/RP03** Flipped the divisor d and the dividends x and y (joseph)
21. **MATH135/EP08/RP01** Fixed a substitution typo; the remainder should be 8, not 3 (Yuqiao)
22. **MATH135/EP06/RP09** Flipped the directional arrows of the proof (Vivek)
23. **MATH135/EP08/RPWE2** Should be 4(-4) â¡ 5 (mod 21) (Dan)
24. **MATH135/EP08/RP04**  Can reduce x^26 to x^2 with CFlT -- makes the table less fat (Dan)
25. **MATH135/FE2021W/Q03** Can't apply FlT, since 10 is not prime (Dan)
26. **MATH135/FE2021W/Q08** 7-1=8 (Dan)
27. **MATH135/FE2021W/Q010** Found counterexample (part a) and RHS is not the set of integers (part b) (Dan)
