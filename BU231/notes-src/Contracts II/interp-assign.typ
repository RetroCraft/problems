  As stated by the doctrine of Contra Proferendum, in the case of ambiguous statements in contracts, the courts prefer the interpretation against the drafter. But, how do they resolve the ambiguity?

  A cynic might say, "Why don't we always throw out all ambiguities?". Although easy, the Courts would not be performing their role of encouraging reliance on seriously made agreements. Agreements and Contracts will not have weight if the Court just brushes it aside. Thus, *the Court will make every effort to enforce the contract*.
  
  === Approach to Interpretation
  #block(inset: (left: 1em))[
    - *Plain Meaning*: This approach is the true dictionary purist approach, using the dictionary meaning of the word to make interpretations, recursively referencing the dictionary until a deduction is made. While this seems rigorous due to going "by the book", there is potential danger from different brands of dictionaries giving different results. 
    - *Liberal Approach*: Looks to the intent of the party, as well as cirumstances - notes shared between the parties, context, and existing definitions in any relevant legislature. It minimizes, but does not fully ignore, the importance of the words actually used. It can be dangerous as it allows endless speculation and bias to seep into arguments.
    - *Hybridding*: The case of _Sattva Capital Corp. v. Creston Moly Corp._ has set out a new precedent in how contracts are interpreted, seemingly blending the two - using "mixed fact and law". The Courts start with the dictionary definitions (Plain Meaning), then examine their meaning in the context of the contract and parties (Liberal Approach). They may also consider "trade usages" and local customs on words, as well as the "factual matrix" and surrounding circumstances.

  Third parties can also be pulled in to provide credibility to one side or confirm certain word use.
  
  === The Parol Evidence Rule
  This rule says that if the 2 parties had a written copy of the contract that both agree is complete and accurate, then any Parol Evidence (evidence from outside the written agreement - like past negotiations and explanations) cannot be used to add, subtract or modify the final written contract. A final written contract is final, save for mistakes, rectification, and some exceptions. However, with the advent of the _Sattva_ case, this rule is essentially non-existent. 
  
  === Implied Terms
  An *implied term* is a term not expressly included in the contract, but would have included it if they thought about it (as reasonable people). Think of these as terms that you would not hesitate to put in if asked. For instance, common terms in industry or statute may be implied. A *duty of good faith* is always implied in every contract in Canada, first established in _Bhasin v Hrynew_. Terms that are reasonably necessary to make a contract effective are also applied, as otherwise the fair expectations of a party would be defeated. (Ex. _Nickel Developments v. Safeway_ - leasing space to open a supermarket, then keeping it vacant and not terminating to block out competitors). *Implied terms can be breached!*

  === Privity of Contract
  *Privity of Contract* is a special term that refers to the relationship that exists between parties to a contract. 2 parties with privity impose their own rules on each other, so the Courts generally say those rights or obligations should not apply to anyone outside of the contract.

  This essentially means that if A and B have a contract, *only A and B can sue each other* - no external party can sue or be sued. Without Privity of Contract, you do not have a legal right to obtain a legal remedy through Contract Law (though you can still sue in Tort Law (and apparently Tort Law was developed as an exception to this rule)).
  
  While this may seem reasonable, there are cases where this rule leads to harsh results. Though a third party may not be signing a contract, they can still be affected by it - and can suffer immensely due to a contract breach. Thus, we have exceptions!
  
  === Exceptions to Privity of Contract
  ==== Novation
  *Novation* terminates the first contract and replaces it with a new contract with similar terms but with the 3rd party to the contract instead of the original, releasing them from the contract. This requires the consent of all parties and the 7 elements of contract formation to be met. Once novation occurs the third party has entered a contract, thus gaining privity and the ability to sue.

  ==== Vicarious Performance
  *Vicarious Performance* occurs when a 3rd party performs on behalf of a promisor, who *remains responsible for proper performance*. Think of a subcontractor, or employees to a corporation - it is the employee who performs the work on behalf of the corporation, but it is the corporation who is still liable for performance within the realm of Contract law.

  So long as the contract doesn't have a "personal performance" clause, the party who needed to perform does not require consent from the other party to subcontract as it "would make no difference" with proper performance. The third party taking over does not face contractual liability wrt the *original* contract, but may still face tort liability, leading to the promising party being liable through vicarious liability. I think the subcontractor can still be sued by the party to perform if they had a contract too.

  ==== Constructive Trusts
  *Trusts* are arrangements that transfer assets from an owner (called the *settlor*) to an administrator (called the *trustee*) who looks after them for the benefit of another (called the *beneficiary*). For example, if A is a parent to B, they may enlist C as a trustee to look after their wealth while B is still a child. Trusts split equitable and legal ownership - while the legal owner is the trustee, the equitable owner is the beneficiary. The trustee acts as a fiduciary and the equitable owner (*beneficial owner*) can compel the trustee to provide benefits to them/carry out their duties under the *trust agreement*. Here, only the original trust writer and the trustee have a contract, but the beneficiary can still compel performance even though they are a third party.

  In the case where there was not an "express" trust written or described in a contract, but a clear notional trustee and notional beneficiary exist, a *constructive trust* (aka resulting trust) can be built as an equitable remedy to force the notional trustee to perform (usually to transfer the assets). However, this requires the original contract to have been irrevocable - the trust must be permanent with no option for the settlor of the trust property to later change their mind. 

  ==== Insurance-Related Contracts
  Each province has statutes that allow beneficiaries of an insurance contract to force the insurance company to perform and pay out the contract.
  
  ==== Undisclosed Principal
  If an agent enters a contract on behalf of a 3rd party (called the undisclosed principal), unknown to the other signing party, the undisclosed principal may sue and be sued. See Agency Law for more info.
    
  ==== Contracts Concerning Land 
  The new owners of land must respect previous rights and obligations outlined in earlier contracts in the public record, even if they aren't a party to it. For instance, a tenant leasing land has a duty to pay rent and maintain the property. The owner of the land can swap and the tenant's duties and lease continue with respect to the new owner.

  === Exemption Clauses (Principled Exception)
  Clauses in a contract that exempt liability can also extend protection to third parties such as agents, employees, and directors of companies. The third party can rely on this if the parties *intended to extend protection* to the third party, and the activities of the third party were *within scope* of the contract generally and the exemption clause in particular.

  For instance, as a company, you are allowed to protect your employees, officers, agents, etc, who are vicariously performing for you. You could exclude all liability in Tort and in Contract, or limit liability to some fixed amount. The vicarious performers are technically third parties but still *gain protection* from the contract.

  === Enurement Clauses
  An *enurement clause* extends the rights and benefits to those inheriting from a party, succeeding the party, or taking an assignment from a party. Basically, any "replacements" to a given party get a privity exemption so they can still enforce their inherited rights under the contract; as well as be sued to perform their inherited duties. The usual clause will say the contract "is binding on and for the benefit of parties and their respective heirs, administrators, successors, and assigns" or something like that.

  == Assignment
  === What is Assignment?
  Contractual Rights are valuable! They are commercial commodities that can be bought and sold. *Assignment* is one party transferring its *rights* under a contract to a third party. Note that *only rights or benefits can be assigned* - liabilities and obligations are stuck and cannot be transferred.

  === Parties in Assignment
  The *Promisor* is Party 1, who promises to do something. The *Assignor* is Party 2, who assigns their rights under a contract. *Assignee*, Party 3, receives the rights from Party 2. Parties 1 and 2 have a contract, and the assignor's rights are assigned to the assignee.

  === Choses in Action and Choses in Possesion
  #block(inset:(left:1em))[
    - *Choses in Possession* are rights to tangible property that can be possessed physically.
    - *Choses in Action* are rights to _intangible_ property, like patents, stocks and other contracts. Their value is derived from the fact they can be enforced by action in the courts. For example, the right to enforce a (separate?) contract can be assigned and is a chose in action.
  ]

  === Equitable Assignment
  Equitable Assignments are any assignments that do not fully meet the statutory requirements to be legal. Usually, this is when the assignor doesn't give up ALL of their rights, as that is required for it to be a Common Law assignment. Another way for it to be an equitable assignment is if it falls under the _Conveyancing and Law of Property Act_ and is not in writing (the act requires it to be in writing).

  If Equitable Assignment applies, the assignee may receive the benefit of the contract from the promisor, and a contract breach would impact them. Practically, the original assignor is left as a party to the contract, and thus to enforce the contract *all 3 parties must be included in any legal action*.

  === Notice to the Promisor
  Assignments *require notice* to the promisor, however *consent is not required*. The promisor ignores a notice of assignment at their peril. If they _ignore the notice_ and perform for the assignor instead of the assignee, the promisor will be in breach of contract and will *need to perform again*.

  === Assignee's Title
  The assignee can never acquire a better right to sue the promisor than the assignor - in legal terms, their claim is "subject to the equities", and the assignor can only assign what they have. The assignment is also subject to any rights that the promisor had against the assignor _before_ they received notice. 
  For example, the equitable right of *set-off* allows a promisor to deduct any debt owed to them by the assignor at the time of assignment. They also have a *right of recission* - apparently the right to cancel/terminate the contract?
  
  === Assignments by Operation of Law
  In some cases, assignment is statutory and involuntary. When you *die*, any contractual rights to you are assigned to the executor of your will. In *bankruptcy*, all assets, including contractual rights are assigned to a court-appointed trustee in bankruptcy.
