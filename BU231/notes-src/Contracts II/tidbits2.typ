   == Odds and Ends

   === References Exist
   A *reference* is simply asking the Courts to make a decision, rather than a full-blown lawsuit. For example, _Ontario Mushroom Growers v. Learie_ was a reference to ask the Courts to interpret if mushrooms were a vegetable (and thus if minimum wage law exemptions to vegetable farmers apply).

   === "Time is of the Essence" Clauses
   These clauses emphasize that performance must be completed on time (for example, delivering highly perishable goods on time). The timing becomes material to the terms of the contract - could be a major breach if it wasn't delivered on time!

   === Failure to Perform and Installments
   Inadequate Performance leads the non-breaching party to ask, "Do I end this now, or insist on performance"? This is troubling with installments - partial delivery for the installment now could be annoying, but in the future, they could make up for this deficit!

   In this case, the innocent party could terminate and sue, but then see the courts absolve it as a minor breach. Thus the party should consider if:

   If they say yes to both, they may consider themselves freed from liability.

   - Writs filed with the Sheriff do need to be renewed regularly every few years or so to stay current.
   - Judgements remain in effect for 21 years.
   - The notice of judgment can also be placed at various credit rating bureaus to affect the JD's credit rating and notify others of the outstanding debt.
   - An *Examination in Aid of Execution* is basically an examination under oath (appear and don't lie or contempt of court) to figure out where a JD's income and assets are so they can be yoinked. As Prof Masterman says, this is perhaps the worst part of being a lawyer. Apparently, they are allowed annually.
