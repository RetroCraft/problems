  == Introduction to Contract Law
  === What is a Contract?
  A contract is a *set of promises* that the law can enforce. In general, it is any agreement. 
  === The Suspicions of a John Swan, the Prof's Prof
  When Prof. Masterman was learning about Contract Law, his prof. told him that

  This seems to be due to their observations about how the courts sometimes handle similar court cases, giving contradictory verdicts without any certainty. They hypothesize that the courts are actually *manipulating the rules* to choose who they want to win. So no one really knows the rules!

  In particular, the courts basically decide who gets the insurance payouts so they move accordingly. This is important to keep in mind in contract law.
  
  === A Rant on the failure of the Law of Precedent
  The Courts follow the *Law of Precedent* - Lower Courts follow rules established by Upper Courts in their previous rulings. This is why decisions in cases matter - they set a precedent to be followed! This is ultimately because the courts are trying to *eliminate the courts* - in the end, every possible case would have had a precedent!

  However, this is a bit of a failure as lawyers keep piling on $infinity$ exceptions as $t arrow infinity$, so there is never a precedent! Keep this in mind with contract law - past contract rulings might have no effect.
  
  === Equity VS Common Law
  Another thing to remember is how *equity* plays into the law - what is deemed fair. This could be yet another exception! For example, equitable remedies.

  === Contract Law Stairway
  1. What is a Contract, formally?
  2. What are the defences to a contract (how can you get out of one?)
  3. How is a contract interpreted, especially where there are points of ambiguity?
  4. How are damages awarded?
