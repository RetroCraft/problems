  == Contract Impeachment
  Now that we have discussed what a contract is, we can discuss how a contract can be set aside - a way out, a defense, an ability to reneg.
  
  === Mistake
  Mistakes happen, and despite our best efforts, they can sometimes make it onto contracts. Especially if people start using ChatGPT imo lol.

  ==== The General Principle to Finding Mistake
  Although Mistake has its own subcategories as seen below, Prof. Masterman insists that if:
  #block(inset: (left: 1em))[
    1. There was indeed a mistake in the Contract
    2. The acceptor's interpretation of the mistake is reasonable to a reasonable bystander
  ]
  then the contract is still binding and you will have to deal with that mistake. In other words, a contract can be voidable if the acceptor abuses the mistake to screw over the other party.

  ==== Rectification of Mistakes
  *Rectification* is the correction of written documents to fix mistakes. The courts will fix the terms that contain mistakes, subject to the following:

  For *Mutual Mistakes*, where both parties made a mistake of some sort, the contract doesn't reflect the parties' shared common intention so can be rectified through renegotiation.

  For *Unilateral Mistakes*, where only 1 party claims a mistake was made, the courts need that:
  #block(inset:(left:1em))[
    1. There was otherwise a complete oral agreement between the parties on all terms 
    2. No further negotiations occurred to amend the contract
    3. The mistake in the contract _could have_ been due to fraud (optional)
    4. The defendant (should have) known of the mistake and the plaintiff did not when signing
    5. Any subsequent attempt to enforce the inaccurate document would be equivalent to fraud
  ]
  only then would they rectify the contract. As such, for unilateral mistakes, rectification is *very rare* and an *extreme remedy*.
  
  ==== Mistake in Terms and Meaning 
  ===== Inadvertent Word Usage / Typographical Errors
  Typos happen! If a reasonable bystander would recognize that a mistake occurred, then the contract would be *voidable* by the discretion of the party who made the mistake. The courts could also choose to *rectify* the contract.

  ===== Errors in Recording Terms to Writing
  Usually occurs when an oral agreement is improperly converted to writing. Usually, these parties don't want to void the full contract - thus the courts offer *rectification* as a remedy as outlined by the section on rectification above.
  
  ===== Misunderstanding the Semantic Meaning of Words
  The 2 parties may interpret the same words differently. In this case:
  #block(inset:(left: 1em))[
    - If there are unequally reasonable interpretations, the court will decide which meaning is the most reasonable in light of the fact matrix, and the contract is *binding* under those semantics. 
    - If the 2 interpretations are equally reasonable, then the courts rule there is *mutual mistake* and the contract is *void* for mistake as to the meaning of terms. This is "essentially" an instant defendant win though, if you think about it hard enough.
  ]
  
  ==== Mistake in the Subject Matter
  ===== Wrongly Assuming the Existence of Something
  Oops, you tried to sell something that doesn't exist, or got destroyed; or you're getting insurance for something that's in the middle of being on fire! In these cases, the contract is deemed *void* - obviously there's no way to reasonably enforce that contract.

  ===== Misvalued Assets and Promises
  What if a party made a mistake in the valuation of an asset (and was about to get ripped off)? The Courts will intervene if the mistake in value was present from the outset - a *fundamental egregious mistake* at the onset of the contract (subject to interpretation). The courts will not intervene due to market price flux. The contract gets *voided*.

  ===== False Identities in the Contract
  If one party tricks the other into thinking they're someone they're not, the contract is *voided*. However, the _identity assumed must be an existing one_ - if the identity was fake or non-existent, it's only *voidable* but you can only really get compensation from that "party" listed on the contract so good luck with recovery lol. Strange...

  Also, if mistake in identity occurs but the 2 parties have met in person, the contract is only voidable.
  
  ==== Mistake in Document Nature (Non Est Factum)
  In Latin, it translates to "not my doing" - essentially *"This is not the contract I agreed to"*. This was a very historical defense devised for the illiterate, who could be _tricked_ by the literate party into signing - you're relying on another's word that the document is correct. Today it is often used for persons with blindness or who are illiterate.

  Note - this defense *does not work if you were careless in not reading* - this was the case at some point but the courts reverted that decision. This defense is limited in the sense that you couldn't have been careless yet still signed a document while being mistaken about its nature. 

  === Misrepresentation
  ==== Wait, isn't this Tort Law?
  Well, yes, but *innocent* misrepresentations aren't tortious (although the professional still has a duty to correct). In contract law, any *material misrepresentations* may allow one party to gain the right to rescind the contract. Misrepresentations are not terms of the contract - false impressions!

  ==== Formal Definition of Misrepresentation in Contract Law
  *Misrepresentation* a statement or representation that is made during the negotiation of the contract, *before the contract's formation*, that turns out to be false. 

  There are 3 types of misrepresentation:
  #block(inset: (left: 1em))[
    - *Fraudulent*: The party making the misrepresentation intentionally did so, essentially lying
    - *Negligent*: The party had a duty to ensure the statement was accurate, yet failed to take the steps needed to do so and fell below the standard of care (for instance, a professional)
    - *Innocent*: Any misrepresentation that does not get categorized into the above. It is important to note that parties *must still correct these* when in a position to do so - else it may become fraudulent or negligent!
  ]

  Recall the Elements of the Tort(s) Misrepresentation - the same general outline follows here:
  #block(inset: (left: 1em))[
    1. A statement is made, and that statement is false
    2. The statement is such that it is negligent/fraudulent/innocent
    3. Relying on said statement *caused the injured party to enter the contract*
    4. Relying on said statement caused harm to the innocent party.
  ]
  
  ==== Consequences of Misrepresentation
  As mentioned in Tort, the contract becomes voidable at the option of the victim. Fraudulent misrepresentation allows for rescinding the contract and/or awarding extra damages; while for negligent misrepresentation only 1 of the 2 options are available. Note that the party should rescind promptly lest they lose their right to rescind after an unreasonable amount of time has passed.

  ==== Representations must be Statements of Fact
  A statement can't be a misrepresentation if it is a statement of opinion - this is why saying "In my opinion" is important. However, there is an exception if you are an *expert* (or are perceived to be one?) - expert opinions are considered statements of fact.
  
  ==== Omissions as Misrepresentation
  Omissions are misrepresentations only if there is a *duty of utmost good faith* owed (like a fiduciary duty or implied contractual duty of good faith); or if there is some latent defect (a defect that existed at the time of purchase, not obvious to a _prudent_ buyer, yet serious and important).

  Some contracts *require disclosure* - failing to do so renders that contract voidable. For instance, the insured must disclose to insurance companies info related to their risk; directors to their corporation (as a fiduciary duty); partners in a partnership; and professionals to their clients.

  There is also the rule of *Caveat Emptor*, or *Buyer Beware*. The purchaser is responsible for clearing misrepresentations. This is however countered by the _Sale of Goods Act_, which makes contracts voidable for buyers if the vendor fails to disclose a problem with the ownership, quality, or characteristics of goods. However, the _Sale of Goods Act_ does not apply to contracts involving services or land, so yeah I guess.

  === Undue Influence
  *Undue Influence* is the _domination_ of one party over the mind of the other to a degree that deprives the latter party of the will and ability to make an independent decision. In other words, they have such overwhelming power over them that it's impossible to go against them. If this is the case, the contract is *voidable* to the victim of the influence at their discretion.

  This is often seen in issues with wills, spouses, and other special relationships where one party holds some special skill or knowledge and the other party places trust and confides in them. It also often goes hand-in-hand with duress.

  ==== Test for Undue Influence
  It is up to the plaintiff (victim?) to show, on a balance of probabilities, that:
  #block(inset: (left: 1em))[
    1. There was domination by the other party, as seen in 1 of the below cases:
        1. There exists a special relationship (doctor-patient, lawyer-client)
        2. OR they were in a desperate circumstance at contract formation
        3. OR they were under a threat of prosecution at contract formation
        4. OR the contract was *unconscionable* - unequal bargaining power between the parties
    2. The contract was unfair or disadvantageous to the weaker party
  ]
  In some cases (like spouses), it is presumed that undue influence exists - then the dominant spouse would need to establish that no undue influence was applied!

  ==== Minimizing Undue Influence
  One way lawyers try to minimize undue influence when a contract is signed is through *independent legal advice*. The lawyer would send the weaker party to another independent lawyer and sign it separately to help reduce pressure and influence. But one must ask - given that special relationship still exists, does this _really_ help?
  
  === Duress
  Compared to Undue Influence, *Duress* is *actual or threatened violence or imprisonment* as a way to *coerce* a party to enter a contract. If this occurs, the contract is voidable at the victim's discretion.  

  While historically it outlined physical harm, nowadays the definition of duress is broadened - economic duress (forced payment backed by inappropriate pressure beyond normal competitive commercial pressure) and other types of violence also count for duress! This is part of why it is confused with undue influence so much, I guess.

  == The Requirement of Writing
  === Preface
  For some contracts to be enforceable, they need to be *in writing*, as stated by statute. Prof. Masterman generally considers these as failures due to the court's propensity to manipulate rules and how the statutes benefit those who are aware of them. There are contradictory cases abound here.

  === What is "In Writing"?
  In general, it just needs to be written down - no specific form is necessary, and it could be across multiple scattered documents (however, they cannot be connected through oral promises). Electronic writing and signatures are also sufficient. *Evidenced in writing*, not specifically in writing.

  Essentially, they only need to include essential contract terms - names of the parties, subject matter of the contract, consideration (excepting guarantees), payment details, and signatures of signing parties.

  The in-writing rule is known to be manipulated by Courts to get the ruling they need, as there is room for interpretation as to what counts as "in writing".

  === Contracts to be in Writing from the Statute of Frauds
  #block(inset: (left: 1em))[
    1. The promise of a will's *executor* to pay for an estate's debts (after distribution) with their own \$
    2. *Guarantees*: A promise to pay the debt of another person IF the debtor defaults.
    3. *Indemnities*: In BC only, promises to pay *on behalf* of a third party as long as the other party in the contract performs. *Not conditional on the debtor defaulting*.
    4. *Marriage*: Historically for marriage contracts like bridal dowry, now it is governed by Family Law. However, it still needs to be in writing to be enforceable.
    5. *>1 Year Actions*: Agreements where both parties perform only after a year or more from signing unless the contract has an indefinite time period.
    6. *Land Interests*: Contracts that create an *interest in land* (ownership rights, including leases). A specific exception for these is the *Doctrine of Past Performance* - if both parties already partially performed parts of a land-interest contract, it is considered binding regardless.

  === Contracts to be in Writing from the Sales of Goods Act
  This applies to all provinces but BC and Ontario. So it doesn't apply, but sales of goods usually over \$50 need writing, acceptance, part payment (credit to paying the purchase price), or earnest (token sum or article to seal the deal); otherwise they are unenforceable.

  === Contracts to be in Writing from the Consumer Protection Act
  This applies to B2C contracts only. For Direct Agreements of over \$50 (like door-to-door sales) to be enforceable, it must be in writing and include:
  #block(inset: (left: 1em))[
    #grid(columns: 2, column-gutter: 2em, row-gutter: auto,
    [ 1. Detailed Description of Goods/Services
      3. Name, Address, and Contact Info of Vendor
      5. A Copy must be given to the consumer
    ],
    [ 2. Itemized Purchase Prices 
      4. Notice of Statutory Cancellation Rights
      6. Cost of Borrowing, if applicable
    ]
  )
  ]
  Some contracts under designated industries might be subject to further rules and exceptions too.
