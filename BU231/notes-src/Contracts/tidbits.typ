   === The Basis of the Bankruptcy Act
   The Bankruptcy Act is based on the Debtor/Creditor Rule and its subsequent ruling! If you commit an act of bankruptcy (defined as owing more than \$1000 to 2+ creditors with no way to pay them down), you have 2 recourses:
   #block(inset:(left: 1em))[
     1. Your creditors issue a bankruptcy notice, and all\* of your debt is paid and all\* your assets are liquidated to pay whatever possible.  You start over from ground zero with nothing.
     2. File a proposal to distribute assets to your creditors in return for debt alleviation. If 2 of 3 *blocks* of creditors agree to this proposal (gerrymandering fully allowed) your debt is paid down and you don't enter bankruptcy. This is risky though since if you don't get 2/3 acceptance or can't live up to the proposal, you automatically enter bankruptcy.

   === You need not Perfect Capacity
   The Capacity requirement needed for different contracts may differ. For example, a marriage contract has relatively low capacity compared to say *Power of Attorney* - allowing someone else to deal with your *financial care* (managing your finances) or *personal care* (managing your life and even when to pull the plug) when you inevitably lose the capacity to do so yourself as you become a boomer.

   A general test for capacity is as follows:
   #block(inset:(left: 1em))[
     1. Do they have a sense of time?
     2. Do they have a sense of place? Where do they live and so on?
     3. Do they know who lives near them?
     4. Do they know the size of their assets?
     5. Do they know the nature of the document they are about to sign?

   === Loopholing Damages for Negligent Misrepresentation
   Say hypothetically a misrepresentation is negligent but the courts feel it appropriate to void the contract AND award damages. This is not usually allowed since it is a negligent misrepresentation, so only 1 can be chosen.

   The trick is to claim the existence of an *auxiliary contract* - if the main contract was not entered without having the auxiliary contract, the auxiliary contract follows all 7 needed elements for a contract, and voiding the original contract isn't enough to cover damages, this argument may be allowed and now there are 2 contracts you can recover damages with!
