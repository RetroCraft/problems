  == Elements to a Contract
  There are 7 big elements to a contract. The courts *must see* 3 of the 7 - Offer, Acceptance, and Consideration; the other 4 the courts *assume to have been met* unless 1 party asks to dispute that.
  
  === Offer
  An *offer* is a tentative promise made by one party (the *offeror*) in exchange for conditions/requests from the other party (the *offeree*). Once accepted, the terms are *binding* on both parties.
  #block(inset:(left:1em))[
    - All terms must be *definite and certain*. Specific prices, specific times, etc. No uncertainty!
    - The offer must be *communicated* to the intended recipient - verbally, through writing, digital mediums (with back and forth), or even through actions and conduct. *An offer cannot be accepted until the offeree knows of it*!
  ]
  
  ==== Standard Form Contracts
  *Standard Form Contracts* (*Contracts of Adhesion*) are "take it or leave it" offers, where there is no room for negotiation and you are essentially forced into taking the offer. The most prominent example is that of the parking lot ticket. Although they are fast and easy (and needed for a lot of businesses to run in linear time), they leave the offeree with highly unequal bargaining power and they cannot negotiate terms at all. The question is - how would a consumer get out of the contract?
  
  ==== Contra Proferentum (Against the Offeror)
  The rule of Contra Proferentum can be used to get out of Adhesion Contracts. It states that *any ambiguity in a contract is leveraged against the drafter*. Ambiguities are not binding!

  The specific test for ambiguity is to check that the clause is broad enough to encompass negligence (ex. you can't sue us for negligence) and broad enough to encompass another cause of action (ex. also contract breach). The most common use case for this would be against *Release/Exemption Clauses*.
  
  If both of the above are true, the statement is *ambiguous*! This is why formal contracts are so long - they take the time to list out every specific cause of action.
  
  ==== Inadequate Notice of Terms
  Another way out of Adhesion Contracts is through *Inadequate Notice of Terms*. If you can prove that you were not given enough time to read all clauses and were forced to accept, then you were not given adequate notice and thus the contract is not binding. The definition of "reasonably sufficient notice" may differ from case to case.

  ==== Unexpected Terms (Required Notice of Terms)
  Another way out - for terms that are arguably "unexpected" to the offeree, the offerer must ensure sufficient awareness of the unexpected clause. Essentially, if you have a surprise "gotcha" clause in your contract - one that the offeree would not typically expect in a standard form contract - you must make sure the offeree knows of that clause with sufficient notice. This is usually decided on a case-by-case basis as the definition of unexpected & sufficient notice needs to be argued in court.
  
  ==== Lapse, Revocation and Counteroffers
  *Lapse* refers to how contracts don't last forever. Contracts lapse after a _reasonable_ amount of time, or in a timeframe otherwise specified in the contract. Note: you are allowed to set any time you want as the timeframe for acceptance! (If you don't let the Court choose for you, that is)

  *Revocation* allows offerors to cancel offers at any time *before acceptance*. This has 2 exceptions: *option contracts*, a separate contract where the right to revoke was bought; and *contracts under seal*, contracts with a red dot/X at the end of names (this also extends the litigation period since they are specialty contracts lol). _You cannot enforce irrevocability in the contract_.

  Offers usually aren't a one-and-done deal - negotiations can occur! When one side makes an offer, and the other side makes a *counteroffer* (any modification of the offer), the original offer is considered rejected and is immediately voided. Instead, the counteroffer is a *new offer* that can be accepted or rejected, and the process repeats.

  
  
  ==== Offer and Consumers
  Here are some notable cases involving sales of goods and services as seen in the textbook:
  #block(inset: (left: 1em))[
    - Invitations to do business (aka, _most_ advertisements) are *not contracts*. They simply are ways to entice customers to start a contract of sale. It is the customer who, after being enticed, makes the offer; and the seller who holds the power to accept or reject.
    - Having goods or services provided without request or knowledge doesn't form a contract, since no offer was made and thus accepted. Notably applies to unsolicited goods and services, with additional legislation to prevent "default assumed offer acceptance" if it was unsolicited but there was an untaken opportunity to reject it.
  ]
  
  === Acceptance
  Formally, *acceptance* is the final unqualified (unconditional?) consent to the terms of the offer by the offeree, which is then *communicated* to the offeror by word or by specific conduct. Regardless, the acceptance must be a _positive_ action (silence or no action cannot be an acceptance (unless agreed that it can be)).

  Certain types of contracts are *unilateral contracts* - these are contracts that are accepted by performing act(s) required by the terms of an offer. In this case, acceptance happens _only through performance_ of the acts specified.
  
  ==== The Postal Acceptance Rule
  Special rules apply to contracts negotiated through mail, due to antics related to mail delay. Notably, acceptance is binding when *it is put in the mailbox*, and revocation is only binding when *the other party receives it*.

  This can lead to a funny scenario where the offeree accepts an offer that the offerer was trying to revoke - but the revocation was still in transit when the acceptance was put into the mailbox. The revocation is too late and the contract is binding! lol

  This is also why you DATE all your letters - you need to have your evidence for this sort of thing!

#let Contracts_Elements_Consideration_Others = [
  === Consideration
  Consideration is essentially the *price* - what is exchanged for which the promise of the other is bought. Consideration is usually money, but it doesn't have to be - it can be performance (a promise to act), or goods and services. *Both parties must give something* as part of the contract!

  ==== Gratuitous Promises
  If one party doesn't give up anything, it *does not count as Consideration*. Both promise something! This is why charities usually provide some sort of promise back (even an annual dinner is enough)

  ==== Past Consideration
  *Past Consideration is not Consideration* - Consideration that occurred before the contract was signed *does not count*. In addition, continuing consideration (defined as performing an existing legal duty) doesn't count either - it needs to be *new consideration*.

  ==== Adequacy of Consideration
  The courts do not care if the contract is a fair trade - you are allowed to give a mere peppercorn, and it would be sufficient as consideration. However, both parties must ensure that the consideration is *something they have a legal right to* - for instance, in one case ruling, the right to complain cannot be given up so a "contract" involving that did not count.

  ==== Exceptions to the Requirement of Consideration
  
  ===== Debtor/Creditor Rule & Mercantile Law Amendment Act
  This was a whole debacle of events involving the _Foakes v. Beer_ case, where a debtor could only pay partially, which the creditor originally accepted. They then sued for breach of the original debt contract. The courts ruled in favour of the creditor - since the debtor has not given up *new consideration* (they're getting a freebie with debt relief), thus no new contract was formed & remaining was owed.

  Immediately after that though, legislatures across Canada immediately moved to pass the Mercantile Law Amendment Act - when a creditor *accepts* part performance (positive action of some \$) to settle a debt, and the debtor pays that partial amount in full, then the entire debt is extinguished. This essentially undid the ruling. Despite the lack of consideration, it's a binding agreement!
  
  ===== Sealed Contracts
  As seen earlier under revocation, sealed contracts do not require any consideration to be binding.

  ===== Equitable Estoppel
  #block(inset: (left: 1em))[
    1. Some form of legal relationship between the 2 different parties *already exists*
    2. One party (gratuitously?) promises to release them from some or all of their legal duties to them
    3. The other party acts on that promise in a way that *alters their position* such that if the promiser re-negs on their promise it would provide extreme hardship.
  ]
  In this case, the courts use "equitable" jurisdiction to prevent the promiser from *denying the promise was untruthful* - that party can't back out. Notably this *can only be used as a shield, not a sword* - the promisee uses this to prevent action by the promisor to enforce their original rights.

  === Intention to Create Legal Relations
  Unless brought up specifically during court, this element is assumed to have been fulfilled in a contract. 

  If it is raised though, the courts employ the *reasonable bystander test* - did the outward conduct/context of the 2 parties lack serious intent to create legal obligations (for example, jokes or alcohol)
  
  As a consequence of the reasonable bystander test, the Courts also generally assume you don't want to create legal relations with *family* or in scenarios that *lack common sense* (obviously joking I guess)
  
  === Capacity
  Capacity is the ability for a party to enter a contract. For instance: minors and people with reduced mental capacity. No capacity = no contract.

  Minors are still bound to contracts for supplying *necessary or essential goods or services* - anything needed for their station of life, or anything they don't have an adequate supply of (for some definition of necessary or essential - for example, does a car count?)
  
  In addition, they're also bound by *contracts of service that benefit them* - employment contracts and the like. _Seemingly_, beneficial is defined in the sense of opportunity cost - if there is a better work contract or something it could be argued that the existing work contract is no longer beneficial.

  For any other contract, the minor gets to choose whether they back out or enforce the contract, seemingly allowing them to *void contracts at whim*? As for when the minor reaches the age of majority, the following happens:
  #block(inset:(left: 1em))[
    1. For contracts where they gain a permanent or continuous interest (like things paid in installments), they should back out *immediately* if they want to be released from those obligations; otherwise, they lose the right to do so for that contract.
    2. Any contracts for non-continuous interests require *ratification* (acknowledgment and promise to perform) after they reach majority. This is required, for example, when you buy something where the payment happens after the date of majority.
  ]

  People who have diminished mental capacity follow the same rules as a minor would.

  ==== Aside: Void VS Voidable
  *Void* contracts refer to a contract that never existed, failing to form due to lack of requirements. *Voidable* contracts instead exist, but can be turned void at the option of one of the parties. If a contract is found void, the court tries its best to return the parties to their original positions. It can also decide only parts of a contract are void and *sever* (remove) those void parts of the contract.

  ==== Other Groups with Capacity Concerns
  #block(inset: (left: 1em))[
    1. Corporations - they are separate legal entities and have their own rules on capacity.
    2. Labour Unions, Associations, and other Organizations - unless they incorporate, it's not a separate legal entity - use *representative action* (1 person represents the group in court actions)
    3. Aboriginal Peoples living on Reservations - thanks outdated Indian Act. They are "special unincorporated associations" and have capacity similar to that of a labour union
    4. Bankrupts - under contractual disabilities (save for necessity) until discharged from bankruptcy.
  ]
  
  === Illegal Contracts
  Contracts that violate an Act, Statute, or Public policy are *unenforceable* - the courts cannot provide assistance to remedy. There are some cases where the contract is deemed void under a statute - then the court could still intervene to restore positions but the contract still basically didn't exist.

  For example, contracts going against the _Criminal Code_ (robberies, assassination? idk), the _Income Tax Act_ (sneaky payments to avoid them), the _Competitions Act_ (no anti-competitive behaviour), and the _Law Society Act_ (regulating the legal profession in Ontario) violate acts.

  As for violating common law or public policy, this includes things like compensation (indemnity) for committing torts (bailing out of consequences?), as well as contracts deemed immoral, a perversion of justice, or prejudicial to the interests of the Canadian public.

  Also a thing about the Competitions Act - technically NDAs are unenforceable, unless in the context of sale of business and employment (which is what you usually see them in anyways). The enforcing clauses must be unambiguous in location, activity, and time period for them to be reasonable and enforceable.
  
  === Certainty of Terms
  The terms of a contract must be absolutely certain and unambiguous - if there are any vague or incomplete terms in the contract, it may be deemed *void* by the Courts, and thus no contract was ever formed.

  Examples of vague terms include:
  #block(inset:(left: 1em))[
     - *Fair Value* - instead of explaining how monetary value should be determined, they just use this or an equivalent term to hand wave it. Not OK!
     - *Incomplete Contracts* - Contracts missing essential terms like price, what's being purchased, handover dates, and other items.
