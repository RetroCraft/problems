#let BIP_IP = [
  *Note:* This last 3 sections were covered in 1 single lecture. I'll be brief.
  
  == IP Law
  *Intellectual Property* is intangible property that is the product of mental activity. It is regulated federally through CIPO, the Canadian Intellectual Property Office. IP law aims to incentivize invention, creativity, and commerce; while balancing public use and interest of IPs in science and the arts.
  
  === Trademarks
  *Trademarks* are features used to distinguish a brand, such as logos and brand names. Some special types include *certification marks*, used to identify goods or services that conform to a specific standard; and *distinguishing guises*, the shaping of goods or their containers, or distinctive packaging of said goods. In general, trademarks can be business names, company logos, words in stylized fonts, sounds/chimes, advertising slogans, and domain names.

  ==== Protecting Trademarks
  ===== Common Law
  In Common Law, there is the old tort of *Passing-Off*, aiming to preserve *goodwill*. 
  #block(inset:(left:1em))[
    1. Goodwill must exist - some reputation worth protecting
    2. The defendant must have misrepresented their goods, services, or business as that of the plaintiff
    3. Deception of the public - for casual consumers in a hurry, is there potential/actual confusion?
    4. The plaintiff suffered actual damages, or will potentially suffer damages
  ]
  ===== The _Trade-Marks Act_
  Additional Statutory Causes are provided, essentially prohibiting:
  #block(inset:(left:1em))[
    - Making *false or misleading* statements to discredit a competitor
    - Directing public attention to your stuff so that it *causes confusion* with another competitor's 
    - *Passing Off* other wares or services as and for those ordered and requested
    - Making material *false descriptions* that are likely to mislead the public about aspects of wares.
  ]

  ===== Registering Trademarks
  Though a trademark need not be registered (being something you can gain from goodwill alone), registering it is highly recommended. You don't need to indicate a registered trademark is registered with ® or ™, but it has become common practice.

  With a registered trademark, under Section 19 of the _Trade-Mark Act_:
  #block(inset:(left:1em))[
    - The owner has exclusive rights to use the mark throughout Canada
    - This provides a *complete defense* to claims of passing off (can only attack registration validity)
    - They can register in other countries under international conventions
  ]
  Trademark registration is valid for 10 years and can be renewed forever.

  ===== Requirements for Registration
  When you apply for registration, your mark cannot be:
  #block(inset:(left:1em))[
    - A word that is merely *someone's name* or surname who is alive or died within 30 years
    - Clearly descriptive or deceptively misdescriptive about the character or quality of the wares/services; or their place of origin
    - Name of the wares/services in connection with which it is used
    - Likely to be confused with another registered trademark
    - A protected geographic indication, Olympic, or Paralympic mark (wow the Olympics are special) 
  ]
  Registration is done through CIPO. If the Registrar refuses registration, the owner can appeal to the Courts through *Opposition Proceedings*, which can occur if say the TM isn't "distinctive" or doesn't meet requirements. If that passes, another 2-month round exists for anyone in the public to object.

  ===== Actions for Infringement
  Unlike passing-off, if your trademark is registered, an action of infringement only needs to show *unauthorized use* or use of a *confusingly similar* mark - regardless of whether the infringement is accidental or deliberate. The federal court only has jurisdiction to hear cases from the _Trade-Marks Act_, and judgment is enforceable throughout Canada; provincial courts can additionally handle passing-off, though judgment is only enforceable in the province.

  
  === Copyrights
  ==== Copyright Origin
  Copyright aims to balance public interest in art and intellect with fair compensation for creators alike. It is derived solely from Statute - namely the *_Copyright Act_*. International treaties like the _Berne Convention_ and _Universal Copyright Convention_ also extend copyright protections internationally across all signing countries. Canada is also a signatory to *WIPO (World Intellectual Property Organization)* conventions and treaties.

  ==== What is it though
  Copyright is a collection of distinct rights under the _Copyright Act_, such as:
  #block(inset:(left:1em))[
    - The right to *produce and reproduce* the work or any substantial part
    - The right to *perform and deliver* the work in public
    - The right to *publish an unpublished work*.
  ]
  
  Copyright arises *automatically* without registration or publication! Copyright is owned by the original author, though they may choose to assign copyrights to other people. 

  ==== Moral Rights
  *Moral Rights* are non-transferable and are the rights of an author or creator to prevent a work from being distorted or misused. It also covers the right to prevent it from being used in association with something else, and the right to be associated as the author, or to remain anonymous. 

  ==== Limits to Copyright
  *You cannot copyright ideas* - only the expression of those ideas. Still, doing so can be uncool.

  Additionally, copyright exists for every _original_ literary, dramatic, musical, or artistic work. This includes computer software (as a literary work), plays, ballets, movies (as dramatic works), live broadcasts, music, etc.

  ==== Protecting Copyright
  Copyright automatically exists at the time of creation, though you can still choose to register it. It exists for the lifetime of the author + 50 years longer after.

  ===== Infringement and Defenses
  Copyright is infringed when someone uses the work of the copyright holder *without consent*. Only a substantial part of the work needs to be copied, and the copied work does not need to be identical.

  So what are the defenses?
  #block(inset:(left:1em))[
    - *Fair Dealing* - *minimal* use for research, private study, education, parody and satire, criticism and review, or news reporting is fine.
    - Copying musical works for *private use* - like in your car only
    - Using the material to generate your own content for *non-commercial purposes*, like funny memes online. This is known as the YouTube exception.  
  ]

  ===== Remedies
  Remedies for infringement include damages for profit or income lost by the owner, accounting for profits made by the defendant (if any exist), and injunctions to prevent further infringement.

  Some cases can also be criminal - with fines of up to 1 million or imprisonment for up to 5 years. Instead of actual loss, the plaintiff can also request *Statutory damages* for non-commercial infringement capped at \$5000.

  === Exceptions to Copyright
  There are 3 big exceptions to copyright:
  #block(inset:(left:1em))[
    1. *Group Activity* - If made in group, ex, a music band, everyone has equal right to the copyright
    2. *Employment* - Companies have copyright to stuff made by employees during their employment
    3. *Assignment* - Copyright can be assigned
  ]
  
  === Patents
  ==== Patent Origin
  Patents aim to balance the interests of scientific advancement with the private interests of profiting off said inventions. They are sourced purely from the _Patent Act_, with nothing from common law! There are also international treaties to extend patents worldwide, like the _Patent Cooperation Treaty_ under WIPO and the _Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property_ under the Paris Union.

  ==== What is it though
  *Patents* aim to protect inventions, giving the patent holder a monopoly over the invention for 20 years. However, in exchange they must *make the invention public*, filing an adequate description so that it can be fully duplicated upon patent expiry.

  To be able to patent, you must have an "invention" - a new and useful art, process, machine, manufacture, composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement to such. It must have *novelty* (something new), *inventiveness* (some level of ingenuity - can't be an obvious step), and *utility* (it needs to be useful)

  ==== Obtaining a Patent
  To obtain a patent, you file it with the Patent Office at the CIPO, and include a *specification* and *claims*, respectively a description and features of the invention. The examiner then examines the claim to ensure it is novel and compliant. The patent can be amended to respond to issues, and you may also appeal rejections through the Patent Appeal Board, and then the Courts.

  ==== Protection Patents
  The plaintiff sues the party for patent infringement, and has the burden to prove the patent was infringed upon. If successful, possible remedies include injunctions and damages (accounting of profits, or reasonable royalties).

  Other than claiming non-infringement, the defendant can defend on the patent being *invalid*:
  #block(inset:(left:1em))[
    - *Anticipation* - someone else has known about or used the invention before it was patented
    - *Obviousness* - lacks ingenuity. Can't be patented.
    - *Inutility* - useless. Can't be patented.
    - *Insufficiency* - an insufficient description was provided at patent time.
    - *Non Patentable Subject Matter* - abstract theory and scientific principles etc.

  === Trade Secrets
  *Trade Secrets* are confidential tidbits of information received during employment. They are *not IP*, as they are not property, but they still have commercial value. They are protected by *contract* (NDAs, or agreements/provisions of confidentiality), or through obligations as fiduciaries.

  The tort of *Breach of Confidence* exists to support trade secrets, requiring:
  #block(inset:(left:1em))[
    1. Confidential Information to be communicated to someone in confidence
    2. The information is then misused by the person to whom it was communicated.

#let BIP_Privacy = [
  == Privacy
  *Privacy* is the right to be left alone, and has 3 facets:
  #block(inset:(left:1em))[
    - *Personal Privacy* - the respect of bodily integrity free from unreasonable surveillance, search, and seizure
    - *Territorial Privacy* - the lack of intrusion in one's home, business, and personal spaces.
    - *Privacy of Personal Information* - the protection of the trail of information left behind from daily life involving secrecy, control and anonymity.
  ]

  *Privacy is not absolute* - it is only protected when there is a "reasonable expectation of privacy", and a privacy breach can be justified if there is a serious breach or issue, if it minimally impacts personal privacy rights of impacted people, and if society has an interest in doing so.

  There is also something known as the *right to be forgotten*, saying you have the right to be forgotten about and left alone on the Internet, without a trace of existence.
  
  === Regulations in the Private Sector
  Regulated both federally and provincially where federal law is the backup. It is mainly governed through the _*Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)*_, controlling collection, use, and disclosure of personal information during a commercial activity. It applies to everyone, to the extent that a provincial equivalent does not exist, and regulates *personal information* about natural persons.

  Under PIPEDA, businesses should follow the following principles when collecting information:
  #block(inset:(left:1em))[
    Accountability (having procedure and policy), Identifying Purpose, *Consent*, Limiting Collection, Limiting Use, Disclosure and Retention, Accuracy, *Safeguards*, Openness, Access (provide access to personal info about persons to whom it relates), and Compliance to Challenges (complaint handling)
  ]

  ==== Surveillance of Employees
  Surveillance of employees can take many forms. It is only generally considered reasonable *as a last resort*, where all other forms of collecting information have been unsuccessful. If done, it must be limited to the *least intrusive form possible*.

  Employees have a reasonable expectation of privacy, even on work computers! However, this expectation is reduced if the employer gives a notice of monitoring. If your company has over 25 employees, you must have a monitoring policy detailing how the monitoring may occur.

  === Regulations in the Public Sector
  At the federal level, the _Privacy Act_ governs collection, use, and disclosure of private information:
  #block(inset:(left:1em))[
    - The purpose of collection must relate to operation of progam/activity of the institution and obtained *directly*
    - Consent is required to use the info for a purpose other than what it was collected for.
    - Individuals are entitled to access the personal information held by gov. and correct inaccuracies
    - Collected data must be retained for at least 2 years after it was last used.
  ]
  Provincially, there are also similar legislations governing provincial and/or municipal public sectors, like _Freedom of Information and Protection and Privacy (FIPPA)_ in Ontario.

  Healthcare Records also get additionally regulated by the *_Personal Health Information Protection Act (PHIPA)_*. They govern the collection, use and disclosure of highly sensitive *personal health information* by healthcare providers and custodians.
  
  === Liability for Privacy Issues
  ==== Intrusion Upon Seclusion
  Hey, we've seen this one before! Defendant is liable for the invasion of the plaintiff's privacy if:
  #block(inset:(left:1em))[
    - The invasion is *highly offensive* to a reasonable person
    - The defendant intentionally/recklessly intrudes, physically or otherwise, upon the seclusion of another, or their private affairs or concerns.
  ]
  
  ==== Public Disclosure of Embarrassing Private Facts 
  Also known as the "revenge porn tort" (no actually), liability exists for privacy invasion if:
  #block(inset:(left:1em))[
    - The defendant publicizes a matter concerning the private life of another
    - The matter publicized or the act of publication is *highly offensive* to a reasonable person
    - The matter is *not of legitimate concern* to the public.
  ]
  ==== Negligence
  _PIPEDA_ imposes a duty on businesses to protect personal information securely.
  
  ==== Criminal Liability
  *Willful interception of Private Communications* is only allowed with the consent of 1+ parties, or with court authorization. Mostly used in consideration of admissibility of criminal evidence.
  
  ==== Data Breaches
  If you suffer a data breach, Canada requires you report the data breach to the privacy commissioner under _PIPEDA_. Failure to report, notify and keep records may result in fines under _PIPEDA_
  
  === The Anti-Spam Legislation
  A relatively new legislation, the _Canadian Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL)_ essentially does the following:
  #block(inset:(left:1em))[
    1. Prohibit the sending of spam *without consent*
    2. Provide an *unsubscribe* mechanism for free
    3. Require contact information of the senders in spam messages
  ]

  Consent can either be given expressly or implied, usually due to an *existing business relationship*:
  #block(inset:(left:1em))[
    1. Purchasing or leasing a product, good, or service up to 2 years prior
    2. Acceptance of a business, investment or gaming opportunity within time frame of (1)
    3. Bartering of anything in (1)
    4. Entering a written contract that is currently in existence or expired within time frame of (1)
    5. There was an inquiry or applicate made by the recipient up to 6 months prior

#let BIP_Intl = [
  == International Law
  As trade goes international and grows complex, there is risk in financial and contractual terms.
  
  === Managing Risk
  ==== Incoterms
  *Incoterms* are standard contractual terms adopted by the International Chamber of Commerce, which deal with cost, control, and liability (who pays/deals with what etc.) in trade, notably export contracts.

  ==== Financing Risk
  Transport times from seller to buyer are much longer in international sales. The seller would like to receive payment as soon as goods leave the factory, but buyers want to pay only after receiving the goods. This can be accommodated through *letters of credit*:
  #block(inset:(left:1em))[
    - The buyer gets a letter of credit from their bank, who sends it to the seller's bank
    - The seller's bank, reviewing the terms, gives it to the seller
    - The seller then ships the goods and submits the documents back to the bank
    - After checking the terms, the seller's bank sends the letter to the buyer's bank, who sends payment
  ]
  
  === Determining Jurisdiction

  ==== The First Step
  First, the Courts decide whether the province the lawsuit is started in has jurisdiction at all. This is satisfied if the defendant is *present* in the jurisdiction, *consented* to submit to their jurisdiction, or if the case has a *"real and substantial connection"* to the jurisdiction. For example: 
  #block(inset:(left:1em))[
    - Whether the defendant is a resident or does business in the jurisdiction
    - If the tort was committed there, or if a contract connected to the tort dispute was made there
    - If a contract was to be performed in the jurisdiction, or has terms detailing the jurisdiction
    - If damages from a breach of contract were sustained there, or if the dispute concerns stuff there
  ]

  ==== The Second Step
  The Courts may refuse to hear a proceeding as another jurisdiction is more appropriate or more closely connected to the matter, a principle known as *Forum Non Conveniens*. The defendant must bring this up, btw. Some factors may include the location of parties and witnesses, service (providing) of documents, relative ability to enforce judgement, avoiding multiple proceedings, standing (your case has an applicable law in this jurisdiction), and applicable laws (what laws apply).

  === Enforcing Foreign Awards
  There is no obligation for one jurisdiction to enforce the judgments from another - questions can arise to its legitimacy, like whether it was made in the appropriate forum, if it was legitimately obtained, and if it offends against natural justice or public policy. They tend to be enforced only if the foreign court properly assumed jurisdiction.

  To check if its enforceable, you *apply to the court* in the jurisdiction where the assets reside to request recognition, or *start a new action* in the other jurisdiction and seek judgement there.
