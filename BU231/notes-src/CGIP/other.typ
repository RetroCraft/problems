  === Notice of Dissolution
  Remember to hand notice about your registered sole proprietorship if you decide to dissolve.

  === Sole Proprietorship Proportionality
  SPs are really easy to set up, thus they tend to be small but numerous. Their numbers also fluctuate proportional to the economic situation - in boom times small businesses flourish better, while in recession they are usually the first to shut down, as they are easy to start and drop at any time.

  === _Salomon v. Salomon_
  The separate existence of corporations as a legal entity distinct from their shareholders was first recognized in _Salomon v. Salomon_ in 1897. Even as a one-man company, the company and its members have been separate, and have been ever since (save for circumstances to recognize shareholder interests).

  === The Sackler Family and Purdue Pharma
  A case study of the potential harm corporations can do to society. Purdue Pharma was founded by 3 brothers in the Sackler family, whose prescription painkiller, OxyContin, debuting in 1995, helped raise 35 billion in profits. It also happens to be a very powerful opioid. What happened after was a lot of overdoses and an entire opioid crisis. Yay!

  No clinical studies were done on its addictive nature at launch, and later when internal reports found it to be so they covered it up. Doctors were bribed to promote it, and "pill mill" doctors were targeted. Their "delayed absorption mechanism" was easy to circumvent giving way too high a dosage at once.

  Also, they patented that "delayed absorption mechanism", but when the 20-year deadline came, they simply made a minor tweak to the recipe and filed for another patent! Technically ok but like, uncool man.

  All Canadian provinces and the federal government sued for 170 million in total, about 0.5% of their total profits. The Sacklers also bankrupted the company, taking all the profits through dividends and leaving none for investors and employees.
