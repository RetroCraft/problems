  == Internal Affairs of a Corporation
  It is VERY easy for the corporation to cause harm to a variety of parties, even itself!
  === Overview Diagram of Corporate Governance
  This also includes items from the next section about External Responsibilities. Made by Prof. Masterman.

  === Who's in the Company?
  The main groups to consider are the:
  #block(inset:(left:1em))[
    - The *Board of Directors*, the governing body of the corporation responsible for the management of its business and its affairs.
    - *Officers*, the high-ranking members of a corporation's management team as defined in bylaws or appointed by directors. For instance, the president, vice president, controller, C-suite execs, general counsel, and general manager.
    - *Shareholders*, the actual owners of the corporation through their investment
    - *Stakeholders*, other interested parties such as employees, creditors, community and so on.

  === Directors of a Corporation
  Directors as a concept come from the _Business Corporation Act_(s), which set out the role of the director. However, the majority of the power comes from their ability to call the General Meeting of the shareholders. 
  
  The _CBCA_ outlines the general power of management, in addition to the following:
  #block(inset:(left:1em))[
    1. The power to issue shares
    2. The power to declare dividends
    3. The power to adopt bylaws, or amend existing ones, subject to shareholder approval
    4. The power to call the meeting of shareholders, including an annual general meeting that must be called each year
    5. The power to delegate their *general responsibilities* and appoint officers; however, the specific powers cannot be delegated.
  ]

  ==== Managing Your Directors
  The _CBCA_ requires a corporation to have 1+ directors, and for publicly held corporations there must be 3+, 2 of which must be independent (not employees of the company). Initial directors are appointed by Articles of Incorporation, but must hold the General Meeting of Shareholders within 18 months of incorporation. Subsequent directors are elected by shareholders, and can sit for at most 3 years before needing to be re-elected (though they can be removed earlier by a Special Meeting of shareholders)

  Notably, *Shareholders cannot direct directors* - directors are not obligated to follow their orders, notably meaning shareholders cannot compel the directors to declare dividends, subject to explicit requirements in the constitution.
  
  ==== Duties of the Director and Officers
  In addition to complying with the _CBCA_, regulations, articles, bylaws, and any unanimous shareholder agreements, the directors have a fiduciary duty and a duty of care, diligence, and skill.
  
  ===== Fiduciary Duty
  Under the _CBCA Section 122 (1)(a)_, every director must *act honestly and in good faith* with a view to the best interests of the corporation. This is essentially a fiduciary duty to place the corporation's interests above all else. This fiduciary duty is *only owed to the corporation*, not shareholders or stakeholders (not to say there is no duty to these parties, just not fiduciary?).

  Under this fiduciary duty, directors must avoid conflicts of interest, declare any conflicts of interest, and not vote on those matters (or the board can rescind any subsequently formed contracts). They also cannot intercept *Corporate Opportunities* (any opportunity in the same line of business, that the corp. has or would have an interest in, that creates a conflict of interest when taken by the director, and that the company could've taken up if they knew of it). They also cannot carry on business in competition with the corporation.

  If a breach of fiduciary duty occurs, the director can be held liable for losses from the breach. Any property acquired by the director as part of the breach will be held in a *constructive trust* in the name of the corporation, and if the property was transferred to a genuine purchaser, the director is liable to account for the profits.
  
  ===== Duty of Care and Skill
  Under _(1)(b)_, every director must also *exercise the care, diligence, and skill* a reasonably prudent person would exercise in comparable circumstances. This is not just owed to the corporation, and opens up negligence as a cause of action.

  Directors can be negligent, however, the standard of care used here is that of an *ordinary person*, rather than a professional. You just need to know enough about the company to ascertain whether it is being run properly. Directors can rely on information provided to them, so long as they are not *wilfully blind* - you can choose to ignore the materials, but you should read and challenge any material provided and not be blind to mistakes and misconduct.

  A director can be personally liable if:
  #block(inset:(left: 1em))[
    - They acquiesce in situations of misconduct or negligence
    - They vote for a financially detrimental decision leading to insolvency (liable for unpaid wages)
    - Taxes are not paid (in which they are liable for HST and employee deductions)
  ]
  
  ===== Defenses
  #block(inset:(left:1em))[
    - The director can argue *due diligence*, that they had indeed meet standard of care requirements
    - Good faith reliance: directors that relied on audited financial statements or expert reports can argue this (even if the auditing is from their own employees and maybe sus)
    - The *business judgment rule*: so long as the decision seems reasonable (being arrived at with appropriate prudence and diligence), the Courts will *not second guess business decisions*. In other words, they won't care if it's a good decision - just that the way it was reached was not negligent. But, this does not apply everywhere - for example, for failure to comply with specific legal obligations like mandatory disclosure.
  ]

  ==== Illegal Insider Trading
  *Insider trading* is the user of confidential information relating to a corporation in dealing with its securities. Except for US politicians (for SOME reason), this is illegal and has liability in all forms - *civil* (compensation for losses), *regulatory* (fines and imprisonment), and *criminal* (fines and imprisonment but from the Criminal Code instead of the _Securites Act_).

  There is also a requirement to have a *strict disclosure record*, showing each time an insider performs a trade in the company. This is essentially an insider trading record and helps enable investigation.
  
  ==== Conflict of Interest
  As mentioned earlier, if a director has a conflict of interest wrt a particular vote, they must declare the conflict and abstain from voting.
  
  === Shareholders of a Corporation
  Shareholders own the corporation, and their rights are derived from the Articles of Incorporation and legislation. The _CBCA_ stipulates that the constitution of the corporation should set out the classes of shares, including their rights, privileges, and restrictions.

  ==== Rights and Duties of the Shareholder
  At least one class of share must include all 3 of these rights:
  #block(inset:(left:1em))[
    - The *right to vote* at any meeting of the shareholders
    - The *right to receive dividends* that are declared
    - The *right to receive remaining property* on the dissolution of the company.
  ]
  
  ===== Voting
  This is the chief method shareholders use to voice how they think the corporation should be run. These occur during *general meetings of shareholders*, and every year by statute there is at least one *annual general meeting*. Shareholders are entitled to advance notice of all GMs. 

  ====== Ordinary and Special Resolutions
  Voting is the passing or defeating of these resolutions, and there are 2 main flavours as per _CBCA_.

  *Ordinary Resolutions* are passed by a simple majority, and encompass most of the day to day decisions of business. The _CBCA_ also requires that approval of any *amendments to bylaws* by the director, election of the *auditor*, and election/removal of *directors* be done through ordinary resolution.

  *Special Resolutions* require a supermajority (usually 2/3), and cover items that fundamentally change the nature of the corporation, such as *changes to articles of incorporation*, or *other fundamental changes* like mergers or sales or significant/all parts of the corporation's property.

  ====== Share Classes and Voting
  Not all shareholders have the right to vote - some classes only have the right in specific cases, such as preferred shareholders, who only vote when preferred dividends are in arrears. Especially in closely-held corporations, some shares may have more votes than others. However, in commonly traded companies, it's usually 1 vote a share, or else the people would riot. 

  For publicly traded companies, a shareholder can nominate a *proxy* to attend the general meeting and vote on their behalf.
  
  ===== Return on Investment
  As we know, shareholders purchase shares to invest in the corporation. The investment is realized through dividends and capital growth. Why does this slide exist
  
  ===== Issuance of New Shares
  Given that the board of directors can issue shares, shareholder equity can be diluted easily, and a majority shareholder could lose their majority position. Additionally, there is the risk of "stock watering" - where new shares are issued at a price less than the value of existing shares, dragging down the value of existing shares.

  In the US, there is the principle of pre-emptive rights, ensuring that new shares must be distributed pro-rata. However in Canada, *there is no pre-emptive right*. However, directors can only issue shares *to raise capital* or for purposes in the best interest of the corporation. In other words, directors cannot issue shares to affect voting control (like diluting a majority). If this occurs the issuance may be declared void.

  While not required to, most corporations apparently do give a pre-emptive right, allowing shareholders to either gain shares or sell the rights on the open market.
  
  ===== Right to Information
  Shareholders have a right to information! Annual *financial statements* must be presented to the shareholders at the annual general meeting, as seen in BU127. To assist in the analysis and evaluation, the shareholders can *elect an auditor*, who checks the statements for fairness. The auditor's report, along with the financial statements, are sent to shareholders at least 3 weeks before the AGM as part of the *annual report*.

  Only the auditor and director have the right to access the books of account - *the shareholders do not*. Instead, they send requests for the auditor or directors to investigate the books, but they have no obligation to follow through. As a last resort, shareholders can ask to courts to appoint an *inspector* to look through the books.

  However, shareholders do have access to *documents of record*, which can be examined by any shareholder during usual business hours. These usually include shareholder meeting minutes, registers of all share transfers (including insider trading), copies of the charter, bylaws, articles, and special resolutions, as well as registers of all shareholders and directors. Notably excluded are the _minutes of director's meetings_ - only the directors alone can access those.
  
  ===== Duties of the Shareholder
  Nope! The courts ruled consistently that majority shareholders can just do whatever, their obligation ended when the full price of their shares was paid. If the shareholder is a director, they of course must comply with the directorial duties to act honestly and in good faith to the corporation; but as a shareholder, they are entitled to consider their own personal interests in voting.
  
  ==== Protection of Minority Shareholders
  When a majority shareholder exists, they get to call all the shots. This means that minority shareholders are often "frozen out" of the decision making process. Worse yet, they often can't dispose of their shares in smaller companies (very few buyers + lots of restrictions on selling shares), meaning they are effectively locked in. Completely legal, yet not very democratic, especially if the majority shareholder changes the business fundamentally or pursues their own interests. 

  So, how are these minority shareholders protected? We have special statutory remedies.
  
  ===== Appraisal Remedy
  In some cases where the majority shareholders make a fundamental change to the corporation, a minority shareholder who dissents is entitled to the *appraisal remedy*, the right to have one's shares bought by the corporation at a fair price (or if the parties disagree, a price the courts deem fair).

  This remedy is limited to specific actions by the majority, and applies less than you think. Notably, it applies when one of the following occurs:
  #block(inset:(left:1em))[
    - A change of restriction on issue, transfer, or ownership of shares
    - A change of restriction on the type of business the corporation can carry on
    - Any merger or amalgamation with another corporation
    - Selling, leasing, or substantially changing all the assets of the corporation
    - "Going Private" or "Squeezing Out" transaction
  ]
  This remedy is only really useful for privately held companies (just sell your stock otherwise lmao). The dissenter must also comply with every step in the Act to take advantage - which can be quite complicated and cumbersome. 
  
  ===== Winding Up
  A very rare remedy, *winding up* dissolves the ENTIRE corporation. This only occurs where animosity between the shareholders grows to the extent that business is impossible, when the courts decide it is "just and equitable" to do so.

  The courts have been especially reluctant to do this if the corporation is still viable and reasonably large, as it would affect other stakeholder interests like the employees. So it's commonly seen in small family businesses or "incorporated partnerships". Highly effective though - the mere threat of its use can often persuade the majority.
  
  ===== Oppression Remedy
  The most common and widely applicable remedy (which applies to people beyond shareholders!), *oppression remedies* are statutory procedures that allow individual shareholders to receive a personal remedy if they were unfairly treated.

  To justify the remedy, the plaintiff must show that the action they are complaining about:
  #block(inset:(left:1em))[
    - Is *oppressive or unfairly prejudicial* (ex. be a unique loss to you)
    - Unfairly disregards the interests of the complainant
  ]
  To determine fairness, the Courts look at the *reasonable expectation of the parties* - based on the nature of business, past expectations, and so on. Was it reasonable for the complainant to have these expectations about how their interests are managed?

  The usual remedy is to have the corporation buy back the shares at fair market value, but it can be more, or less! The Courts are empowered to make any order they consider just and appropriate to remedy the situation.
  
  ===== Derivative Action
  A *derivative action* is a proceeding brought by one or more shareholders in the name of a corporation, wrt a wrong done to the corporation. For instance, when the corporation suffered an injury, or the directors exploited a "corporate opportunity". Usually, an action on behalf of the corporation must be started by the directors, so if the action is against themselves, they probably won't start that action. This allows the minority shareholder to start that action.

  The shareholder must obtain leave from the Court to bring an action in the name of the company. They need to show:
  #block(inset:(left:1em))[
    - The directors are unwilling/refuse to bring the action themselves
    - They are acting in good faith
    - The action appears to be in the interest of the corporation, or its shareholders
  ]

  The courts can order that the corporation pay the costs of the shareholder bringing in the action, at any time. If the defendant loses the damages are paid in whole or in part *directly to shareholders* rather than the corporation (which would be the one suffering said damages). However, these are not given - the shareholder can be on the hook for lawsuit costs and what not.
  
  ==== Shareholder Agreements
  As motivation, consider a group of equal partners moving to incorporate. After incorporation, instead of being partners, they will be minority shareholders, losing some of their protections from partnership law. How can this protection be approximated?

  *Shareholder agreements* are agreements between 2+ shareholders that are distinct from the corporation's charter and bylaws. However, these agreements can only apply to the parties in their capacity as shareholders, and cannot fetter the discretion of a director. In other words, the agreement must be restricted to their role as shareholders, and cannot infringe on their role as directors.

  ===== Sample Terms
  #block(inset:(left:1em))[
    - *Right to Employment* - shareholders are allowed to be employed at the corporation?
    - *Right to Participate in Fair Management of Business* - the shareholders promise to elect each other to the board of directors and only each other, also promising not to vote for major changes to the business without unanimous agreement.
    - *Right to Fair Price for Share Interest* - the shareholders agree to a regular method for valuing their shares, and to not sell to outsiders without checking first, etc. Can also stipulate selling interest at appraised value in breach, or buying out interest in wrongful expulsion/dismissal.
  ]
  
  ===== Unanimous Shareholder Agreements
  *Unanimous Shareholder Agreements* are ones where all shareholders are parties. The _CBCA_ has specific recognition of USAs, allowing them to fetter (restrict) the power of directors. Almost as if they were part of the corporate constitution.
  
  Any subsequent purchasers/transferees of the shares also get *assigned both rights and duties* stipulated (not just the rights as per assignment!).

  An USA is really only possible in a closely held corporation, and the presence of one must be *noted conspicuously* on the face of any share certificate.
