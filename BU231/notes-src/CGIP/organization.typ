  == Sole Proprietorships and Partnerships (but mostly partnerships)
  Say it together with me! Sole proprietorships! Partnerships! Corporations!

  === Sole Proprietorships
  *Sole Proprietorships* are unincorporated businesses owned by a *single*  individual, who bears all the pros and cons of the business. The individual is sued in their name. Business income is earned in their own name, and is taxed at the individual marginal tax rate. 

  ==== Registration
  There are about 44,000 registered sole proprietorships in Ontario, registered through the _Business Names Act_. You only have to register if you don't operate in the actual name of the individual - registration doesn't change liability but you just gotta.

  ==== Pros and Cons
  While very simple and not requiring registration at all in most cases (simply start your business!), you are subjected to the higher personal income tax rates, and have *personal liability* for all debts which can even transfer onto your estate after you die! 

  === Partnerships
  Fully defined by the 45-page "readable" _Partnership Act_, *Partnerships* are relationships that exist between persons carrying on a business in common, aiming to profit. There are a few flavours:

  === General Partnerships
  A general partnership is automatically created if 2 or more people:
  #block(inset:(left:1em))[
    1. Are *carrying on* (continuously performing stuff for) a *business*
    2. The business performed is *in common*
    3. The business has a *view to profit* (charity and non-profits can't be partnerships)
  ]
  However, in more formal business settings, there is usually a *partnership agreement* that sets out the terms of the partnership, which can be fully decided by the parties, rather than being bound by statute that dictates corporate structure, as seen in corporations.

  ==== Legal Nature 
  ===== Continuing Nature
  General Partnerships have *no independent existence*. It merely represents the joint rights and duties of all the partners together. Thus, every time a new partner is added, or another dies or leaves, the partnership is terminated; and another new partnership is created in its place. 

  ===== Partnership Property
  Though having no independent existence, partnerships *can still own property* distinct from the individual partners. The individual partners don't own the property, instead having an interest in it.

  ===== Liability (to Creditors)
  If there is a liability (debt) to creditors of the partnership, they first obtain assets of the partnership, then take assets of individual partners.
  
  ===== Legal Liability
  Partnerships are treated like separate entities, and a partnership's name can be used in a suit without naming partners as plaintiffs. Individual partners are responsible for paying the judgment.

  ==== Creating a Partnership
  As mentioned earlier, partnerships come into existence through agreement, express or implied; though it is a good idea to create a *partnership agreement* (get a lawyer to help too). There is also generally no formal requirement for registration, though some provinces require the filing of a declaration, providing info about the partnership, partners, and any changes. 

  ==== Contractual Liability of a Partner
  Based on the principles of agency (every partner is an agent to the partnership) and privity of contract, every partner is unlimitedly and *jointly liable* for the obligations of the partnership - all of them are personally liable. Choose your partners carefully as you will be liable for whatever they do.

  ===== Timing and Apparent Partners
  Under *pre-partner liability*, a new partner does not suddenly become liable for the previous actions of the partnership; and similarly under *post-partner liability* a partner who retires does not stop being liable for debts or obligations incurred while they were a partner. The only escape is through novation with the remaining partners and the creditors.

  *Apparent Partners* are similar to the concept of apparent authority in agency - if someone appears to be a partner of the firm, they will be liable as if they are one. This also applies to retired partners whose names appear on the firm. 

  ==== Tort Liability and Breach of Trust
  Firms are also liable for "any wrongful act or omission of any partner acting in the ordinary course of business of the firm". Thus *all partners are jointly liable* for injuries or damages caused by any single partner during the course of business. Pick friends wisely!

  ==== The Relationship Between Partners
  In addition to what is outlined in the partnership agreement, there are some extra implied terms in statute, and ruling from fiduciary duty.

  ===== Implied Terms Through the _Partnership Act_
  #block(inset:(left:1em))[
    1. *Partnership Property*: all property, as well as rights and interests to property, that is brought into the partnership's accounts for doing business is *partnership property* and must be held and applied by the partners exclusively for the partnership. No private use of partnership property!
    2. *Financial Arrangements*: 
    - (a) All partners *share equally* in the capital and profits, as well as share the loss. 
    - (b) If a partner incurs personal expenses or liabilities doing business, they must be paid back. 
    - (c) They aren't entitled to interest on their contributed capital "before determination of profits". So, if the agreement pays "interest" on a partner's contributed capital, it is not counted as an expense for the firm - it is an appropriation of profits.
    - (d) No partner is entitled to enumeration for acting in the partnership business.
    3. *Conduct of Business*:
    - (a) All partners may take part in management of the partnership business
    - (b) No change can be made to the nature of the partnership without *consensus*; however, changes to ordinary matters only need a *majority*
    - (c) Books and records of the partnership are to be kept at the place of business so all partners can access and inspect a copy.
    4. *Membership*:
    - (a) New partners can only be introduced with the consent of all existing partners
    - (b) You cannot assign your share of profits in the partnership in a way that "permits the assignee to interfere with the partnership".
  ]
    ===== Fiduciary Duties
    Essentially, the "fiduciary obligations" are *equality, consentualism, and utmost good faith*. Here are some specific duties (that cannot be altered by the agreement):
    #block(inset:(left:1em))[
    - *Information*: All partners must have true accounts and full information on all things affecting the partnership. Equality in that no partner is excluded.
    - *Secret Benefits*: All partners must tell each other about any benefit derived by them without the consent of the other partners from any transaction involving the partnership's assets.
    - *Duty to not compete*: Don't compete with your own partnership.
  ]

  ==== Termination and Dissolution
  Termination can be specified under the agreement, but the default rules under statute say that this occurs *by notice or expiry* (telling you want out/expiry of a fixed term), *by death or insolvency* (someone dies or goes bankrupt), or through *Dissolution by Law* (a partner is mentally incompetent, permanently incapable, guilty of conduct that will harm business, breached an agreement; or where it is just and equitable to dissolve)

  When the Partnership dissolves, its assets are used to pay out debts and liabilities to the firm's creditors, and the remaining is distributed proportionally to partners.

  === Limited Partnerships
  A unicorn in the partnership space, these are guided by the _Limited Partnerships Act_. There are 2 classes of partners: *general partners* who have unlimited personal liability, and *limited partners* who have liability limited to the amount invested, but *cannot actively manage the partnership*, kinda like a shareholder. (there is 1+ GP and 1+ LP as well). LPs also have strong restrictions on when they can take their money back out (6 months notice & full consensus??) so it's a bit sus to be an LP.

  === Limited Liability Partnerships
  A fairly new invention to cover businesses that can't incorporate (like accountant/lawyer firms), these partnerships stipulate that while limited partners are liable for their own negligent actions (or negligence in anyone they control or supervise), *no one else is personally liable*. The LLP as a whole is liable, but the liability stops before it gets personal. However, this only applies to negligence - nothing changes for tort/contractual liability. LPs and LLPs are completely different, btw.

  === Joint Ventures
  *Joint Ventures* are agreements between 2+ parties to collaborate on managing a *specific project*, sharing the work and profits. These are not partnerships due to the lack of continued business and other provisions, but can be determined to be one in court?

  Legally, these are contractual and sometimes are called *contractual joint ventures*. However, there is a different flavour called *equity joint ventures* where the parties create a jointly-owned corporation to carry on the venture. In this case, it is subject to the general rules of corporation law, rather than contract law.

  === Income Trusts
  Income trusts involve the transfer of income-producing assets from an operating company to a trust, created through an agreement known as the *declaration of trust*, which also designates trustees. All income becomes property of the trust instead of the company, which is distributed to *unitholders* (beneficiaries of the trust), rather than the shareholders. These were cool back then for tax "strategy" to avoid a layer of taxation, but they killed the tax advantage in 2008.

  == Corporations
  === Nature of Corporations
  Corporations are legal "persons" formed by incorporation under statute. They are different:
  #block(inset:(left:1em))[
    - Shareholders have *limited liability* - they can only lose up to their initial investment and do not attract direct legal obligation.
    - Transfer of Ownership exists through selling shares, though in a limited way. 
    - Management and control of the corporation have been separated
    - There is *no duty of good faith* for shareholders - buy shares at your own risk!
    - Corporations have continuity and can last forever, rather than dying and being reborn.
    - They are taxed separately under corporate tax rates.
    - As separate entities, they can sue and be sued.

  ==== Consequences of Separate Legal Personalities
  It used to be that corporations only had the capacity to perform for purposes stated in their constitution. Now, under CBCA and provincial equivalents, corporations have *full capacity*. They have independent civil/criminal liability, and some constitutional rights.

  ==== Limitations on Limited Liability
  If shareholders receive *improperly paid dividends*, where a dividend is paid when the corporation is not profitable, the director authorizing the dividends *becomes personally liable*.

  Generally, smaller companies get contracts that have *personal guarantees/indemnities* on them from creditors to reduce risk, meaning the limited liability thing doesn't hold in the first place.

  The _Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act_ also says that directors are liable if a business goes bankrupt, for example being liable for outstanding employee wages. 

  There are also *preferences/fraudulent conveyances*, where you prefer 1 shareholder over others (or otherwise delay or defraud other creditors) in insolvency, you could be liable for the money owed.

  ===== Lifting the Corporate Veil
  In rare cases where
  #block(inset:(left:1em))[
    1. One individual within the corporation controls the corporation
    2. The control is used to commit a fraud, wrong, or breach of duty
    3. Such misconduct caused injury to the plaintiff
  ]
  The courts may choose to *lift the corporate veil*, disregarding the separate existence of corporations and exposing said controlling individual to personal liability.

  === Methods of Incorporation
  In the really old days, you would incorporate through a *royal charter* - where the Crown would give you a special license to carry out a particular activity, like HBC! We then moved to *special acts of Parliament*, special legislative acts that create specific corporations, especially for large projects of public interest. They are still used today to form "utility-y" companies and special Crown corporations.

  The modern way to incorporate is through a general *incorporation statute*. You get 2 main choices, which just differ in jurisdiction. There is the *_Canadian Business Corporation Act (CBCA)_*, which is more suitable for large businesses which operate nationwide; and provincial equivalents like the *_Ontario Business Corporation Act (CBCA)_*, more suitable for businesses that operate within the province.

  === Corporation Constitution
  Two articles fully define a corporation, dictating its function and how they do things completely:
  #block(inset:(left:1em))[
    - *Articles of Incorporation*, the founding corporate document created through the incorporation of the company. This can list the corporation's name (which must include "Corp", "Inc" or "Ltd" btw), registered office, classes & number of shares, rights, and restrictions on shares, number of directors, and any other restrictions on business.
    - *Bylaws*, the internal working rules of a corporation. The board of directors can adopt new bylaws or amend old ones, subject to approval by shareholders through a majority vote (or supermajority vote in cases). A bunch are passed at the first meeting of shareholders to explain general operating rules. For example, one of the first bylaws to pass is usually to designate a signing authority, so the corporation can get a bank account.

  === Public and Private Business Corporations
  *Private Companies* are corporations with a restricted number of shareholders that are prohibited from issuing their shares to the general public. Nowadays, the distinction is that private corporations do not issue their shares to the public. In contrast, a *distributing corporation* issues its securities to the public. It is also known as an issuing corporation, reporting issuer, or publically traded corporation. Distributing corporations are subjected to more regulations on provincial levels.
  
  *Professional Corporations* also exist - these are special business corporations founded by members of certain professions, as they are otherwise barred from incorporating their practices due to statute or the professional body's rules (like lawyers/doctors). PCs solve the same problem as LLPs, though the limited liability is not complete as an incorporator remains responsible for their own negligence and misconduct. The main advantage of a PC is taxes.
  
  === Corporate Capital
  Corporations raise money by issuing shares (equity) or borrowing money (debt). At incorporation, the corporate charter places an upper limit on the number or money value of shares they can issue, which is called the *authorized capital*. *Issued capital* are shares that have been issued; and *paid-up capital* are shares that have been issued and fully paid for. (Apparently, shares must be fully paid at the time of issue, so there isn't a difference anyway. What?)

  Regardless of whether an authorized capital limit is stated, the corporation must still have a *stated capital account*, stating the amount received by a corporation for the issue of its shares.

  === Corporate Securities
  As per earlier, *shares* are documents that prove a member's proportional interest in the business and its capital. Shareholders can vote at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) or special meetings of shareholders. 

  Corporations can issue 1+ classes of shares, however, each share within a specified class must have the same rights, which can include rights to dividends, voting, and share in distribution when winding up. 

  A common setup is to have *common shares*, which have voting rights attached to them, but have no entitlement to dividends and are paid out last in liquidation; and *preferred shares*, which are entitled to dividends before other share classes (if any are paid), but no right to vote. Preferred shares may also have *cumulative rights* - the preferred shareholder is entitled to arrears (i.e. unpaid dividends) from previous years before any dividend is paid on common shares.

  *Bonds*, documents evidencing a debt owed by a corporation also exist. Bondholders don't have a voice in managing the corporation, only stepping in if the corporation is in financial difficulty or in breach of the trust deed. As (usually secured) creditors, bondholders get paid out first in liquidation.

  ==== Share Transfer Restrictions
  Private corporations almost always restrict share transfers, to keep them private. Under the _Securities Act_, any restrictions on share transfer must be listed in the articles of incorporation or the share certificate. Often, it is required to get prior approval of the board before transfer.
