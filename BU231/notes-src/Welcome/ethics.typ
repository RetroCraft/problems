  === Ethics
  ==== Incrementalism
  *Incrementalism* is the act of inching deeper and deeper into ethically questionable territory, starting with something small. "People don't wake up one day and decide to start a life of crime". It is a slippery slope!

  Be careful in everyday business - you can easily slip from something relatively trivial into something worse and worse, which may result in performing super illegal actions. Be aware of this, I guess?

  ==== Overconfidence Bias
  *Overconfidence Bias* is the tendency to be overconfident in their ability, skill, economic situation, driving skills, and so on... 
  
  Executives in companies may also be susceptible, undermining the importance of luck in success. Empirical studies have shown that overconfident CFOs are more likely to commit financial reporting fraud too! It may get them into a predicament where fraud is the only way to deliver results.

  Irrational correctness can blind you to your own ethical-ness, which can bleed into the workplace. Most people are overconfident in their ability to make ethically sound decisions (thus making unethical decisions), including you! Be aware of this, I guess?
