  === The Canadian Legal System
  ==== Division of Power
  The Canadian Law system is essentially split into 3:
  #block(inset:(left:1em))[
    - The *Executive Government*, who are law enforcers. They operate, implement, and enforce all laws created by the legislative branch. At the federal level, there is the Crown (Governor General), the Prime Minister, and their appointed cabinet; at the provincial level, there is the Crown (Lieutenant Governor), the Premier and their appointed Cabinet Ministers
    - The *Legislators*, who are law makers. They are elected officials who debate, amend, and make laws. At the federal level, there are members of Parliament and the Senate; at the provincial level, there are the Legislative Assembly, who are members of the provincial parliament.
    - The *Judiciary*, who are law interpreters. They administer justice by interpreting and applying laws.

   ==== Sources of Law
   Canadian Laws come from Legislation, the Criminal Code, Common Law (or Civil Law in Quebec), Equity (ensuring fairness), and the Constitution.

   These laws interplay with each other:
   #block(inset:(left:1em))[
     - *Constitutional Supremacy* - every law, regardless of source, must comply with the Constitution.
     - *Legislative Supremacy* - as long as they are constitutional, the legislature has unfettered discretion to pass any laws they want.
     - *Common Law*: There is the policy of *Stare Decisis*, where the Courts will adhere to *precedent* when making decisions. Also, note that Quebec is special and uses the Civil Law System instead.

   ==== Forms of Justice
   In addition to the Courts, we have Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) such as mediation or arbitration, and Administrative Tribunals like the Human Rights Tribunal or Ontario Securities Commission.

  === Legal Risk Management
  #block(inset:(left:1em))[
    1. *Identify the Legal Risks* - assess the organization's functional areas and review business decisions. Determine the organization's business relationships and assess them
    2. *Evaluate the Risk* - Assess the probability and severity of the potential loss
    3. *Devise a Risk Management Plan* - Either avoid, eliminate, reduce, transfer, or retain the risk - it depends on the previous steps!
    4. *Implement and Monitor the Plan* - yeah.
