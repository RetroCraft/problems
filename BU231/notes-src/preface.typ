  These are my compiled notes for *BU 231 - Business Law, Spring 2024* with Keith Masterman. These notes represent mostly material from lecture slides and lectures themselves, and content from the textbook. Some internet sources were used to complement certain content.

  To the above, the usefulness of each note may vary - I have tried my best to highlight important bits with bold or italic font, but ultimately please use your own discretion. Another important thing to note is that *no case-specific information* is included here unless the case is super important.

  I absolve myself from being liable for any negligent misrepresentation or omissions that may occur from using these notes. If something is wrong, or if you feel something is missing, please tell me and I will update it whenever I get around to it.

  These notes were written up in Typst.
