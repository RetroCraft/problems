  == Unintentional Torts (Negligence)
  Negligence is the biggest type of Unintentional Tort out there - so much so that it _could_ cover all.
  === Definitions
  *Negligence* is the _careless causing of harm_ to the person or property of another. It has 4 elements:
  #block(inset:(left: 1em))[
    1. The defendant owed the plaintiff a *duty of care*
    2. The duty of care was breached as the defendant *fell below the standard of care*
    3. *Harm/Damages Occurred*
    4. The defendant's actions *caused* the harm/damages.
  ]
  
  === History
  In the past, around the Industrial Era, there was (of course) horrible mistreatment of workers, sending workers to die in the mines in droves. Workers tried to sue for Duty of Care, however back then Duty of Care was outlined in the contract - and since no contract was signed, they can't sue! Employees used to not have a duty of care to workers aside from what the contract says. Thanks capitalism.

  But this all changed in the fateful *Donoghue v. Stevenson (1932)* case. Donoghue had bought a ginger beer from Stevenson, which apparently contained a decomposed snail. She got ill and sued. After lots of failure in the lower courts (since there's no direct intent to tort), this eventually got to the highest courts, who said "Nah wait sec hold on a moment". They expanded and established the General Principles of Duty of Care significantly, and the principle of "Neighbours in Law"
  
  === Duty of Care
  A *duty of care* is any relationship to which one could foreseeably cause harm to another. As outlined by Donoghue v. Stevenson, *"You must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions which you can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbour"* - you should think of them!

  A *neighbour in law* is anyone who is closely and directly affected by one's actions; such that one should reasonably have thought they'd be affected when performing the negligent act. 

  The general test (also called the "Anns Test") has 2 steps:
  #block(inset: (left: 1em))[
    1. Is there a sufficiently *close relationship* between the parties such that the damages caused by carelessness from one of the parties is *reasonably foreseeable*?
    2. Are there any policy concerns or considerations that should limit the *scope*, the *class of persons* to which it is owed, or the *damages* that a breach of it should give rise to?

  === Falling Below a Standard of Care
  In general, falling below a standard of care means that you did not do what a *reasonable ordinary person* would have done in the scenario; thus the negligence! There are some exceptions:
  #block(inset:(left: 1em))[
    - Professionals have additional standards they are held to, and must act like a *reasonable and competent person in their profession* if the negligent act requires specialized skill/ knowledge.
    - Professionals must also *avoid conflicts of interest* as part of their standard of care.
    - Specialists in a field are held to a higher standard than generalists - surgeons v. the family doctor.
    - Children are held to the standard of a reasonable child of the *same age*; unless they are engaged in an adult activity (like driving), then it's a reasonable adult.

  === Injury and Causing Said Injury
  Harm or Loss must occur for negligence to occur, but did the defendant _cause_ it to happen? 
  
  ==== The "But For Test"
  This test simply states, "*but for* the conduct of the tortfeasor, would the harm/injury have happened?" If yes, then this is the cause of the loss or harm! Essentially, outcomes that would have been inevitable cannot be sued for - the acts of the defendant must have caused it.

  Note that the defendant does not need to be the _sole_ cause of harm - it is sufficient to show the defendant's conduct, in part, was *a cause* for the harm.
  
  ==== Res Ipsa Loquitur (the thing speaks for itself)
  This is a doctrine that allows judges to make a "Quantum Leap of Logic" to automatically deduce liability regardless of evidence, since the sheer fact that this accident occurs implies negligence. Usually seen in manufacturing. Formally, it has these parts: #block(inset: (left: 1em))[
    1. The injury would not have occurred (or is really unlikely) if no one was negligent
    2. The defendant (usually the manufacturer) was likely the negligent party
    3. The plaintiff did not *voluntarily* contribute to the accident occurring
    4. There is no other evidence that explains how the accident occurred
  ]
  
  ==== Malfeasance and Nonfeasance
  *Nonfeasance* refers to failing to provide a positive act (for example, not saving a dying person). In Ontario, it is *not punishable*, unless explicitly stated to be in statute.

  *Malfeasance* says that if a positive act was provided, but done negligently, the actor is liable for any *additional damages caused* (like saving a drowning person but dragging their face across the rocks and giving them head trauma). The positive act fell below a certain standard, and thus there is liability.

  Interestingly, Google distinguishes *malfeasance* and *misfeasance* - misfeasance states that the damages caused was *unintentional*; while malfeasance states that it was *intentional*.

  == Other Unintentional Torts  
  
  === Product Liability
  In short, the plaintiff must prove that the product *fell short of reasonable standards*, thus harmful.
  
  ==== Subcategories to Product Liability
  #block(inset:(left: 1em))[
    - *Negligent Design*: When the product itself was designed badly (i.e. exploding Ford Pinto)
    - *Negligent Manufacture*: A glaring mishap in the manufacturing process (like a snail in ya soda)
    - *Failure to Warn*: Failing to warn consumers about faulty products (not sending recalls, not putting safety warnings, etc.)
  ]
  ==== Ongoing Duty to Warn
  For some products, manufacturers have an *ongoing* duty to warn users of the risks of using its products, and send notice to them if something comes up (if that advice is heed is not their responsibility - that's then voluntary assumption of risk).

  This applies to dangerous products (cigarettes, explosives, corrosives), products found to be defective, and new scientific or technological advancements. This especially applies to any *unexpected risks*.
  
  === Occupier's Liability
  This outlines that people who occupy/own (tenant/owner) a property *owe a duty of care* to anyone who enters those premises. An occupier is any person who has control over the property. Essentially, people entering your property should not die or get injured due to the condition of the property.

  A separate duty of care is also owed to _trespassers_ - they are still owed a *duty of general humanity* and thus you *cannot set traps* - you *cannot create harm*. Otherwise, the standard of care is minimal.

  If signage is placed, it depends on the ambiguity of the wording and if a notion of consent exists. Also, if the sign is visible (and for that matter, if the plaintiff can read).

  
  === Failure to Supervise
  An interesting new tort: says that people have a duty to supervise children, and if the child causes or incurs damages, the supervisor can be liable. This includes babysitters, teachers, etc.
