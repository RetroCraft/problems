  == What is a Tort?
  
  === Definitions
  A *tort* is a wrongful act done to the property or person of another, recognized by law to be as such. Its main use is to *determine and allocate compensation* for *harm that has occurred*.

  The *tortfeasor* is the person who commits a tort. Usually, they are being sued and are the Defendant.

  Torts usually appear in civil cases where the burden of proof isn't absolute - instead, the evidence of proof is a *balance of probabilities* - usually $> 50%$ chances.

  Torts usually result from the Courts - so the perpetual question is, *"Did the Courts get it right?"* The legislation can sometimes disagree with the courts - they can then make their own torts lol

  
  === Intentional VS Unintentional Torts
  Torts come in 2 flavours, *intentional torts* and *unintentional torts*. Intentional torts require that the action that _causes_ the tort be done intentionally, and harm to have occurred. However, the tortfeasor doesn't necessarily need to wish for the tort to occur.

  
  === How Torts are Made and Change
  Torts are recognized by law - the Courts have judged this matter before and decided that *"society's values have shifted such that this tort should be sueable"*. If a tort doesn't exist, the Courts must be sufficiently convinced to add it as a new tort!

  As society's values change, torts can be added and removed at will to best fit!


  
  == Liability, Defenses, and Damages

  === Liability and Fault
  *Liability* is well-named. Who is liable for compensation related to a tort?
   
  ==== Strict Liability
  Liability is based on causation, regardless of blame or motive. If you were ultimately the person who caused damage to occur, then you're liable. 

  ==== Fault
  Fault is unjustifiable injurious conduct that intentionally or carelessly disregards the interests of others. If you have fault, you are liable! This was created to help deter such faulty behaviour from happening; however it is sometimes defective in undercompensating if fault cannot be shown, and sometimes overcompensation too. Also takes more time to litigate, and so on.

  ==== Vicarious Liability
  *Vicarious Liability* states that employers (any supervisor) are generally liable for torts their employees committed while employed. The employee is not freed from liability - both victim and employer can sue. This applies to any *reasonably foreseeable torts* committed by employees.

  ==== History of Liability in Torts
  Strict Liability used to be how all torts operate - regardless of blame or intention, if you did the damage, you were liable. No matter what. eventually, we moved on and started using fault for some torts, although others still operate with strict liability, notably public/private nuisance.
  
  
  === Defenses for the Tortfeasor
  The tortfeasor has a few defenses against torts (negligence or intentional or otherwise). The judge however can only pick ONE defense. This changes the decision, so the judge decides how harsh to be!
  
  ==== Contributory Negligence
  This defense says that Plaintiff in part contributed to their own injuries and thus Defendant isn't _fully_ at fault. The plaintiff cannot recover damages fully - up to a $%$ of rewards, decided when the judge/jury *apportions liability*. If they are unable to apportion it, it defaults to 50/50 though!

  ==== Voluntary Assumption of Risk
  The defense says that Plaintiff knew *both physical and legal* risks (they'll get hurt + waived the right to sue) and *voluntarily* assumed the risk. Then Plaintiff is barred from recovery (zero compensation!)

  ==== Ex turpi causa (from a dishonorable cause)
  If the Plaintiff's injuries occurred while performing an illegal activity, they are awarded zero. However, this defense is controversial and *rarely* used since judges are not supposed to judge morals.

  ==== Consent
  If the Plaintiff *informed consents* to a tortious action, no wrong is done and no recovery is possible.

  ==== Self Defense
  This defense is usually seen in intentional torts (like assault and battery). This happens when the Plaintiff took *only reasonable steps* to prevent harm to themselves, and only when it's the *last resort* and they have no other options to get out.


  === Types of Damages
  Damages refer to the compensation that is awarded to the Plaintiff to offset their injuries from the tort.
  
  ==== Special (Pecuniary) Damages
  These are *quantifiable* damages that can be claimed - extra expenses otherwise not incurred, loss of wages, any bills, funeral costs - as long as it's reliably quantifiable, it would fall under this.

  ==== General Damages
  These are *non-quantifiable*, like damages for pain & suffering, loss of future earning capacity, etc.

  ==== Punitive (Rare) Damages
  These technically do not correlate to any injury suffered by the Plaintiff; instead, the Courts are *punishing* the Defendant for egregious behaviour to make sure it doesn't happen again. This happens more in the US, with larger punitive damages as well.
