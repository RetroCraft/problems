  == Fun Facts

  === How long can you wait to sue someone after a tort?
  In general, 6 years after a tort occurred; unless you are a child at the time, then 6 years after adulthood.

  === Tort of Harassment?
  There is a tort of harassment in the US, but not in Canada, mainly due to the problem of intention - was the harassment intended, I guess?

  === Defamation and Anti-SLAPP Laws
  Defamation leads to interesting free speech issues, especially when it comes to media coverage. News agencies might just find themselves being sued for exposing things, and then be silenced since the Plaintiff has lots of money to throw. This is called *strategic lawsuits against public participation (SLAPP)* and they intimidate and silence criticism by dragging critics through legal hell.
    
  Anti-SLAPP laws try to remedy this. If the defendant makes a motion to dismiss the case since "this is a matter of public interest and this trial is frivolous". The plaintiff then needs to show they ain't bluffing - show the case has merit, with actual evidence that will cause irreparable damage to them. If they can't do this the suit is dismissed instantly!
  
  In summary, Anti-SLAPP laws help news organizations protect themselves from being bullied with defamation lawsuits.

  === The Thin-Skulled Plaintiff
  This is a principle or law that says that tortfeasors "take their victim as they find them" - if the Plaintiff suffers injuries or damages that are unexpectedly severe due to some precondition or vulnerability, they are still liable even if the damages are higher than if the victim were an "average person".
  
  === The Courts do not want you to sue people
  They are trying to minimize the number of cases they have by limiting liability (so you can't sue everyone). In doing so, they are sometimes unfair and favour those who can pay for lawyers. They're trying their best.
