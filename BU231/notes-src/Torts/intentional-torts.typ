  == Intentional Torts
  As mentioned earlier, intentional torts require the tortious action to be *intended* (though the tort itself can be unintended). In addition, harm *must* be caused. 
  
  Each tort has *elements* that define it. All elements of the tort *must be present* for the claim to succeed; the onus is on the plaintiff to prove the elements exist.
  
  === Assault
  This is intending to cause a trespass to the person. This is usually found together with battery.
  #block(inset: (left: 1em))[
    1. *Intentionally*
    2. Uttering a *threat*
    3. Likely to cause a *reasonable apprehension* of imminent physical harm
    4. Against a *person or an identifiable group*
  ]
  
  === Battery
  Actually committing violence that was threatened in the assault tort.
  #block(inset: (left: 1em))[
    1. *Intentionally*
    2. Applying *unlawful force*
    3. *Without Consent*
  ]
  Interesting examples include Nonconsensual Doctoring - if a doctor operates on you without your consent, each instance they touch you counts as a battery! Another example is in sports - if there is deemed to be "too much contact" it could be a battery.

  Common defenses to this tort are that it was *consented to*, explicitly or implicitly.
  
  === Intentional Infliction of Mental Distress
  A relatively new tort that recognizes acts that lead to physical/psychopathological harm. This tort *requires intent to cause harm*, but actual harm caused does not need to be the harm intended.
  #block(inset: (left: 1em))[
    1. Defendant's Conduct was *flagrant and outrageous*
    2. Defendant calculated their actions will *harm the Plaintiff* (aka, they intended to harm)
    3. Defendant's Conduct caused Plaintiff to *suffer visible and provable illness*.
  ]
  
  === False Imprisonment
  Restraining/Confining someone against their will unlawfully. It *need not be physical* (psychological OK too! (like threats I guess)) It is not false imprisonment if the police lay charges, so when in doubt just *call the police* instead of doing a citizen's arrest or something.
  #block(inset: (left: 1em))[
    1. *Intentional*
    2. *Total Confinement* of a person against their will
    3. *Without Lawful Justification*

  There is a relatively new defense to this - *Shopkeeper's Privilege*. If you are *very reasonably* sure that someone is committing a crime (for instance, a shoplifter in ye shoppe), you could use this as a defense in court, even if the person ended up being innocent! However, to be clear, you still did the tort. 

  === Malicious Prosecution
  As described - reporting a person to the police when there is no good reason to believe that person committed a crime.
  #block(inset: (left: 1em))[
    1. A Proceeding *initiated by the tortfeasor* so that:
      1. They withheld exculpatory information from the police
      2. They undermined the independence of the police investigation
      3. They communicated with police so that it misled them not to conduct an indep. investigation
      4. They undermined the indep. of the decision-making process to lay charges and prosecute
    2. The Proceeding terminated *in favour of the plaintiff* (no charges laid)
    3. Undertaken *without reasonable and probable cause* to commence/continue the investigation
    4. *Motivated by malice* or some other reason other than carrying the law into effect.
  ]
  
  === Defamation
  Making *untrue* statements that cause injury to the reputation of another. Can either be *slander* (spoken) or *libel* (written). Notably, *they assume that harm is done*.
  #block(inset: (left: 1em))[
    1. *Defamatory material* that lowers the plaintiff's reputation in the eye of a _reasonable_ person
    2. Material must *refer to the plaintiff*
    3. The material must be communicated or published to *at least 1 other person*
  ]
  
  There are cases where defamation is not possible:
  - In court and legislation, defamation is not possible as the speaker has *absolute privilege*
  - When the speaker has a responsibility to provide a statement, and it was without malice and within the relationship or job scope, the speaker has *qualified privilege*.

  === Trespass
  The act of entering another's land without their consent. It is important that *harm needs to be done*.
  #block(inset: (left: 1em))[
    1. *Intentionally*
    2. *Entering Property*
    3. *Without Consent*

  In law, your land stretches up towards the heavens and down towards the earth's center. Back then, this meant that people could (and did!) sue for airplanes trespassing on their skies lol. 
  
  === Public Nuisance
  This tort is *strict liability*. It is interference with the use of public lands, often quasi-criminal. For example, occupation of public spaces, etc. The only defense is to show damages were *trifle*. 
  
  === Private Nuisance
  This tort is *strict liability*. Interference with an occupier's use and enjoyment of their land. It includes both physical nuisance but also *amenities nuisance*, interfering with the use of amenities on the property. Like with Public Nuisance, the only defense is to show damages were *trifle*.

  === Intrusion on Seclusion
  An important extra tort to know in Ontario at least; it involves *breaking the rights of privacy* and *causing harm*.

  === Negligent Investigation
  An example of a new tort - a mix of classic negligence with a focus on Crown/police investigations
  
  === Dog Owner's Liability Act
  An example of a strict liability tort - in legislation, dog owners are strictly liable for dog bites/damage!

  === Wrongful Birth
  This tort exists - you can sue your doctor if they failed to advise against your birth, given extreme circumstances and lifelong suffering and the like.
