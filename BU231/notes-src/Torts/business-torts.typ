  == Business-Related Torts
  
  === Passing-Off
  This is essentially forgery, when you attempt to "pass off" one of your products as those of another party, unfairly taking advantage of their brand power and misleading consumers.

  === Product Defamation
  Defamation but for someone's property. Not much to say here.
  
  === Inducing Breach of Contract
  Occurs when the tortfeasor knows of a contract signed between 2 parties and takes *active* steps to break said contract. For example, stealing employees from one of your competitors. Not cool.
  
  === Unlawful Interference with Economic Relations
  Here, unlawful is the true meaning of the word - doing something genuinely criminal or quasi-criminal, with intention to injure/interfere with someone's ability to do business or earn a living. (Ex. Bribery)
  #block(inset:(left: 1em))[
    1. There is an existing business relationship the defendant *knew about*
    2. The defendant *intended* to act to interfere with it
    3. Acts taken to interfere are *illegal*
    4. This interference caused a *loss*
  ]
  
  === Negligent Misrepresentation
  A tort that was conceived in *_Hedley Byrne & Co. Ltd v. Heller and Partners_, [1964], A.C. 465*. Though the Plaintiff lost the courts still decided to start recognizing this and became formal in 1971.

  *Representation* is any statement - written, verbal, or action. *Misrepresentation* is thus any untrue statement. Negligent Misrepresentation covers cases where it was untrue due to carelessness. Especially important for professionals - you're responsible for *not doing this*!
  #block(inset:(left: 1em))[
    1. A statement is made that is *false*
    2. The statement Maker owes the statement Hearer a duty of care (subject to policy considerations to limit liability - are you an actual client, etc? Important due to internet info spread - it could potentially open up unlimited liability to all, which is absurd)
    3. The statement fell *below the standard of care*
    4. The Hearer *reasonably acts* on the Statement and suffers a *loss* as a result of the action taken.
  ]
  
  === Fraudulent Representation
  Established in the same case above, it comes misrepresentation that is *intentionally untrue*, so lying.
  #block(inset:(left: 1em))[
    1. A statement is made that is *false*
    2. The statement Maker knows the statement is false (They're lying!!!)
    3. The Hearer *reasonably acts* on the Statement and suffers a *loss* as a result of the action taken.

  Fraudulent misrepresentation often has higher damages than negligent ones - the court could rescind the contract and/or award extra damages - *or* for negligent; but *and* for fraudulent. Thus fraudulent misrepresentation is the better recourse if possible.
  
  == Liabilities Part 2
  === Fiduciary Duty
  A *fiduciary duty* is an overarching "super duty" that if X breaches, X is liable. A hybrid between tort and contract that applies in certain scenarios. Please don't try to find fiduciary duty everywhere - this only applies to certain scenarios with imbalanced power.

  A *fiduciary* stands in a *special relationship of trust to another*. They are the dominant party to a subservient party, who relies on them. Fiduciaries also apply to some professionals who act in a "trust" relationship with their clients. 
 
  A previous court case _Frame v. Smith_, [1987] SCR 99 at 136 defines a *fiduciary* as follows:
  #block(inset:(left: 1em))[
    1. Has the scope to *exercise some discretion or power*
    2. Able to *unilaterally exercise power* to affect beneficiary legally or practically
    3. The beneficiary is *particularly vulnerable to/at the mercy of* the fiduciary

  Some in-class examples include: the director of a company to the company; a husband holding assets for a wife; an old woman relying on only 1 banker ever; and pension investors to pensioners apparently??? (even if they never even met!) Relationships can change from contractual to fiduciary - if 1 party becomes heavily reliant or vulnerable in a way that only the other party can protect them.
  
  As a fiduciary, your duties include (*in addition to the normal duty of care*):
  #block(inset: (left: 1em))[
    1. Place the beneficiary's interests *above all* (except for the law)
    2. *No conflicts of interest allowed*
  ]
  
  === Professional Liability
  The modern-day definition of a professional is *anyone with specialized knowledge that the general public relies on*. As mentioned earlier, professionals have a higher standard of care, equivalent to any other reasonable professional in the field, and scales depending on their specialization. They also need to avoid conflicts of interest and so on.

  But who do they owe a Duty of Care to? As the General Public relies on these professionals, there could be *unlimited liability* as anyone who even happens on your work (like a published financial report from an analyst on the internet) could claim a Duty of Care and ask for damages. (3rd Party Liability)

  This obviously isn't good, since you would owe a Duty to Care to an absurd number of people. This is why Duty of Care for professionals often is dealt with on a *case by case basis* and is subject to lots of *policies* to limit liability - for the latter, recall the Anns test, which lets us limit liability due to policy reasons.

  Here are some common ways to limit professional liability:
  #block(inset:(left: 1em))[
    - Utilize Policy Reasons to limit Duty of Care: you could argue that the plaintiff is not your client
    - *Retainer agreement*: A contract stating you will do exactly what is contracted of them to do and nothing more; anything else that occurs is not your problem and thus you are not liable for it.
