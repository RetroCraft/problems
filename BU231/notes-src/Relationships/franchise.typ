  == Franchise
  Franchising and Agency can appear to have commonalities, allowing business to grow faster, and having a principal delegate work to someone else to their partial benefit. However, in law, these two relationships are different - franchisees are not in an agency relationship with the franchisor.

  === Definitions
  The franchise relationship is contractual in nature, with the *franchisor* (the big guy) granting a license to the *franchisee* (the little guy), who pays for the license and operates the business independently, using its name and trademark in return for franchise fees. 

  This is a very special business relationship, completely determined by contract. It is *not a fiduciary relationship*, but there is a duty of good faith between the parties - they must be open, honest, and not misleading when interacting with each other.

  === Pros and Cons to Franchising

  === What's in the Franchise Contract
  The *franchise agreement* is an agreement where the franchisor grants the franchisee a right to market the franchisor's products. It usually includes:

    - *Consideration of the Parties*: Opening fees and royalties; trademarks and business practices.
    - *Conduct of the Business*: How the business must run and look, be located, and what is sold, etc.
    - *Termination of the Agreement*: usually requires franchisor consent to protect the franchisor.
    - *Restrictive Covenants*: Limits on either party - exclusive territories, non-competes, etc.
    - *Intellectual Property Rights*: Trademarks & business processes cannot be copied or misused.

  === The Arthur Wishart Act
  As the relationship is contractual and there is minimal bargaining power for the franchisee, there is some law governing franchise agreements/relationships, mainly/only the *Arthur Wishart Act*.
  #block(inset:(left:1em))[
    - *Right to Disclose*: Within 14 days of the agreement, the franchisor should give a full financial disclosure of the franchise's economics. If not, the franchisee has the right to rescind within 2 years and then can be entitled to compensation if there is misrepresentation.
    - *Fair Dealing*: The two parties owe a duty of good faith to each other, in performance and enforcement. But this tends to be a fairly weak defense with big business...
    - *Right to Associate*: Franchisees are allowed to "compare notes" with each other and join an association amongst other franchisees, kinda like a union. Franchisors cannot prevent this nor penalize franchisees for doing so.
