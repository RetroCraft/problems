  == Employment
  An *employment contract* outlines a contractual relationship where one party (the employer) is authorized to direct and control the work of another party (the employee). These contracts can be for an indefinite period (terminating only via resignation or firing) or be for a fixed period. They are governed by Statute (notably the _Employment Standards Act_), Labour Unions, and Common Law.

  === Independent Contractors and Employees
  Whether you are an employee or an independent contractor matters a lot with employment - notably not creating the employer-employee relationship (so no suing for wrongful dismissal).

  In general, it depends on how *integrated* you are into the workspace - more integrated = employee:
  #block(inset:(left:1em))[
    - An employee might be supervised and have control over workers, while contractors control their hours and own their tools to get the job done
    - The duration, nature, and intention of contract formation can clue you in. Method of payment also matters - especially if it is a fixed wage or something.
    - Employees could gain employment benefits, while contractors have exclusivity (?)
    - Contractors bear the risk of loss when trying to profit, use their own time, and assume delivery of the result. Also, fewer/no taxes are levied against their paychecks and are not in pension plans.

  === Relevant Torts and Liability Stuff
  ==== Vicarious Performance
  In contract law, although the employee may not be a signing party, their employer is. The employer (the company) is liable for breach of contract if their subcontractors (their employees) perform badly.
  
  ==== Vicarious Liability
  The employer is jointly liable for any tort actions committed by employees. This also applies to independent contractors too! You cannot escape tort law it would seem.

  ==== Negligent Hiring
  These are claims by customers or other employees against the employer for hiring someone else negligently. This tort is advantageous over vicarious liability as the "own frolick rule" doesn't apply. Occurs when you hire someone without doing suitable tests for capability and damages occur.

  ==== Negligent Retention
  This is a claim that the employer was negligent in retaining or supervising the employee. They later figured out you had issues yet kept you around. It differs from negligent hiring wrt when the issue was discovered - the issues were with the employee from the start for negligent hiring.

  ==== Wrongful Referral
  Negligently referring someone to a professional who is not qualified. Usually, it is only a cause of concern if the employees refer *on behalf of the company* - personal referrals are fine, companies are just terrified of the potential legal consequence, enough to barely put anything down if they do write a referral. If they exaggerate, the other party finds out, and damages occur - the company could be liable!

  === Duties of the Parties to each other
  The employee has a duty to obey (no insubordination), a duty to exercise skill and care in work, and a duty of good faith and fidelity (loyalty?) 
  while employed. In turn, the employer has a duty to PAY.

  === _Wallace v. United Grain Growers_
  This is a landmark case ruling underpinning Employment law. Wallace, a top salesperson at United Grain Growers, despite being assured job security till 65, was fired without explanation in 1986, and in a humiliating way apparently. Wallace sued for emotional distress and wrongful dismissal. The courts eventually ruled in favour of Wallace.

  Before, the courts were pretty limited in when they said employers had a reason to fire. After _Wallace_, they were even more strict and read the reasons very narrowly. They recognized that employees needed protection in society due to the uneven bargaining power with employers and moved accordingly. Compensation needed for firing someone increased, and employers need to act in good faith when firing, lest they accrue extra *_Wallace_ damages* in addition to wrongful dismissal damages.

  The case also establishes a requirement of an independent actionable wrong (like a separate breach of duty of good faith in this situation?) for damages for mental distress to be awarded. Even if it falls short of this requirement, the notice period can be extended. 

  There are also now *punitive damages* if the firing was "sufficiently harsh, vindictive, reprehensible and malicious". One of the rare cases where punitive damages were given out over a contract.
  
  === Termination of Contracts (with Reasonable Notice)
  Employment contracts are usually continuous in nature, so the usual method to discharge them is to provide some form of notice. Generally, the notice period required is governed by statutory and common law and is based on position and length of employment. 
  
  The rule is to be *reasonable* - how long will it take for the employee to find a new *suitable* job given their education, experience, and age; or how long it will take for the employer to find a new employee or fill the position internally (generally, 2 weeks notice).

  Payment can also be given in lieu of notice - notice is either time or money. The money sum is the amount of compensation the employee would have earned during the reasonable notice period.  

  ==== Amount of Notice Required
  The *_Employment Standards Act_* often sets minimum requirements on notice. In addition, *trade practice* also often suggests longer minimums as the norm for each industry. Common law also dictates *reasonable notice* - time needed for the employee to find suitable alternative employment.

  #table(columns: (1fr,1fr,1fr),
  [Trade Practice], [Duration of Employment], [Intention at Contract Formation], [Frequency of Pay], [Level of Position]
  )
  The above factors also determine the reasonable notice period. For instance, the contract could have clauses detailing compensation for termination for intention at contract formation; and high-level positions have fewer alternative openings, and so higher notice.
  
  === Termination of Contracts (Dismissal with Cause)
  An employer *does not need to give notice* if they choose to *dismiss with cause* - when the employee's conduct amounts to a breach of contract, the employer can dismiss without notice and has no further obligations. Common law has classified a few types of breaches that are sufficient for this:

  ==== Misconduct
  This is any crime or bad behaviour the employee commits either in or outside their employment. If either the employer's *reputation is put into disrepute*, other employees are affected, or the act causes direct financial loss, the employee can be dismissed at once. This does mean the employee does not need to cause direct financial harm - it is enough for the employer to no longer be able to trust them. Code of Conduct violations also count provided the employee is aware of it.

  For instance, serious theft (not pilfering though), misappropriation of funds, or breach of the sexual harassment policy are all grounds for dismissal.

  ==== Insubordination
  Wilfully disobeying a *reasonable and lawful* request from your superiors, makes sense.

  ==== Incompetence
  All contracts will have express or implicit terms about your competence. For example, express terms of skill can be items on your resume, application, or interview that you say you possess (these are part of the contract! You both agree that you have these skills). Implicit terms of skill can include how you applied for the job in the first place - implicitly saying you have those certain needed skills.

  There is also the *doctrine of condonation* - condoning incompetence (not firing them early/giving positive ratings) makes claims for dismissal increasingly difficult. You can't go back on your word that you are ok with it! Employers must also make an effort to *remedy incompetence* before dismissal.

  ==== Illness
  If a permanent disability or constantly recurring illness inhibits the employee's ability to perform their work, the employer can consider the contract discharged. However, it is discharged *by frustration*, not breach - so the employer cannot recover damages from the employee. The employment of a person with disabilities can only be discharged after all possible ways to accommodate the disability are exhausted. EI and disability insurance help cover these issues.

  ==== How to Dismiss for Cause
  Post-Wallace, employers should be very careful in how employees are dismissed:
  #block(inset:(left:1em))[
    - There needs to be *clear warnings* to the employee - multiple heads up, maybe with increasing consequences, along with opportunities for the employee to improve their behaviour.
    - While they are still employed, they need to provide adequate training and assistance to rectify any shortcomings. Things like internal courses and such - employers must provide support.
    - They should document the activities of both the employer and the employee, as they bear the burden of proof in the Courts.
  ]
  Thanks to Wallace, employers must assist struggling employees and dismiss them with respect.
  
  === Wrongful Dismissal
  This is a cause of action where an employee claims to have been wrongfully dismissed.

  The only way an employer can defend this action is to say that either:
  #block(inset:(left:1em))[
    - They did have a cause for dismissal (which works even if a cause was discovered afterward)
    - They were dismissed with adequate notice or payment in lieu of notice. 
  ]
  Employers recently have been very good at not being sued for this - they don't ask you to agree to the termination immediately to prevent undue influence and/or duress, and provide just enough compensation to make suing less favourable compared to the instant and no-risk compensation.

  ==== Constructive Dismissal is Wrongful Dismissal
  *Constructive Dismissal* occurs when there is a substantial change to an employee's job that amounts to termination of the existing employment. This could be a demotion, geographic transfer, change in pay structure, etc. If done without notice this can constitute a wrongful dismissal.

  ==== Measuring Damages from Wrongful Dismissal
  Damages aim to return the injured party to the position they would have been if the contract was complete - in this case, they would return the employee to a position where they were dismissed with notice. The damages here come from 3 sources:
  #block(inset:(left:1em))[
    1. *Legislative Requirements* from the Employment Standards Act have bare minimum pay. This applies only if the employer has a total payroll of over \$2.5 million (aka big shots)
    2. *Common Law Damages* for Wrongful Dismissal are estimates from the Court - what is reasonable notice for you to find suitable alternative employment? This figure is multiplied by the value of your employer's pay and all their fringe benefits. 
    3. *Punitive Damages* - also known as Wallace damages until recently, they occur from breaches of the implied term of good faith from firing.
  ]
  Damages can also be levied for mental anguish (see _Wallace_), pain and suffering.

  ==== Damage Mitigation
  Remember, as in all Contract cases, the Plaintiff must mitigate damages. This means job hunting! 
  
  The employee must try to obtain *reasonably comparable* employment, or else the damages award can be reduced. If the employee successfully mitigates, they will receive the difference between the Notice requirement and actual income paid during the notice period as damages, as well as special damages associated with the job hunt.

  ==== Mental Anguish and Damages
  Courts generally do not consider hurt feelings as it is hard to assess the intangible "pain and suffering" and "humiliation", although there is recognition that while employment contracts are economic in nature, there is a human element as well. 
  
  I'm not sure what this builds to... perhaps this is why we have Wallace damages, which provide damages for mental anguish?
  
  === Employee Welfare Legislation - Worker's Compensation (WSIB)
  While the common law recognized employers can be liable for injuries sustained during employment, it was notoriously hard to recover damages, with the employers having many defenses and employee dependants having a hard time showing sufficient levels of proof.

  Each of the provinces replaced the common-law action with a *no-fault compensation scheme*. This only applies to certain businesses where the risk of injury is higher. Employers are required to pay into the fund, and injured employees can apply to get compensation through the fund. Contributory negligence, negligence, and assumed risk do not apply - the only way the claim fails is if the accident was shown to be caused by the employee's willful misconduct. An exception to the exception is if the accident causes death or permanent disability, to which the employee and/or defendants will be able to recover.
