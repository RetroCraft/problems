  == Bonus Facts
  === Agent Criminal Liability
  Agents can be criminally liable! There is this one harrowing case where the principal was an elderly widowed man and the agent (the next door neighbour's kid) gave himself the man's savings and put him in a nursing home where he was badly treated since he couldn't afford services at all. He got charged with fraud through an agency contract. 

  === Why is Undisclosed Principal Allowed
  Why do we let agents say, "I'm working for someone, but who it is is secret :3". This is allowed since disclosing the principal's identity might lead to higher prices, such as in the case of developers trying to accrue neighbouring plots of land to build a large thing on it.

  === Tim Hortons
  Apparently, Tim Hortons always seems to have various lawsuits related to franchise lawsuits. Franchisees sue them a lot of the time and then due to the contractual nature of franchising and Tim Horton's coffers, they probably win. nice

  === Union Shops
  A union shop is somewhere where all employees must be in a labour union to be hired. This means that their contracts may not be governed by common law? Since they bargained those rights away, ig.

  === Being Laid Off
  Employers cannot fire someone during adverse economic conditions - even an express agreement in the contract to forfeit this protection is ineffective as it is in statute. Instead, some statutes allow for *lay-offs* - temporary dismissals with intent to rehire in the future, up to 3 months.

  === Powerful Bailments
  Bailments changed a lot from what it was before - the burden of proof was much lower (just show you're in a bailment relationship and the defendant breached their standard of care), the duty of care was a lot higher (basically strict liability), and there was even a right to leave - after some time you could just sell the property? Or something? It seems to have tamed now.

  === Agreement to Award Priority
  It is possible to agree to award priority over a secured interest to another party. This usually happens when a group of creditors decide internally their priority and lend as a group and they goofed up the priority order in some way.
