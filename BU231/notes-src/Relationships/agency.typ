  == Agency
  === Definitions
  *Agency* is a relationship between two parties - the *principal* and the *agent*. The agent acts on behalf of the principal to bring third parties into a contractual relationship with the principal.

  Think of it as a system of 2 contracts - first, the contract between the principal and the agent detailing agency. The agency then aids the formation of a 2nd contract between the principal and third party. After this 2nd contract, the original agency contract ends (save for continuing agency ig) and the agent drops out of the equation, leaving only the principal-third party contract. This occurs 99% of the time.

  There are a few types of agents - *dependent agents*, who act exclusively for 1 principal (ex. insurance agents for their company, employees in general), and *independent agents* who act as an independent business and work for multiple principals at once (ex. lawyers, stockbrokers). The textbook also mentions a *commission agent* who sells stuff on behalf of the principal, compensated through commissions. 

  === Creating an Agency Agreement
  ==== Through an Agreement
  The *Agency Agreement* is the contract between the principal and agent that outlines the relationship. As a contract, all the normal rules of contract formation apply, notably *capacity*. The Statue of Fraud also commonly applies, and performance over a year out requires it to *be in writing*. *Be sure to set out limits on your agent's authority* - if you can subcontract, timing, value of contracts you enter, restrictions on gifting assets, when to ask for permission, scope, etc.

  Most commonly the agency is a *power of attorney*, authorizing the agent to sign documents on your behalf. These are important for you to be able to get financial and personal care in case you become incompetent, so you see them commonly as you get old.

  ==== Implied (Creation by Estoppel)
  If the principal essentially allows the agent to behave like their agent, the courts can choose to imply an agency relationship if it is equitable to do so.

  ==== Ratification 
  If an agent without a principal or authority (where the principle of apparent authority does not apply), negotiates a contract on the proposed principal's behalf regardless, the principal can choose to later *ratify* the contract as their own, at which point the principal is bound to the contract and thus agency implied. If no ratification occurs, the agent is bound to the contract.

  The ratification must be *timely*, of the *entire contract*, requires the principal to *be capable* of entering the contract at the time of formation, and the principal must be *ascertainable* at contract formation (the principal must exist, or be a company in the middle of being born). Conduct also works for ratification.

  === Duty of the Agent to their Principal
  Basically, it's a fiduciary duty with extra caveats. 
  
  ==== Duty of Compliance
  Agency contracts are contracts and so are binding on both parties. Don't breach it. The Principal can sue if the agent acts outside their prescribed authorities
  
  ==== Duty to Inform
  Agents need to keep their principal informed - the courts have deemed that anything the agent knows, the principal also knows, so you better keep it that way lest you become liable. This applies even if they become incompetent - just the content you would share would change.
  
  ==== Duty of Care
  The agent must show the duty of care of a reasonable agent in similar circumstances, even without payment. Otherwise, that is negligence.
  
  ==== Duty of Personal Performance
  The agent is expected to act *personally* - they cannot delegate their work without prior agreement. There are some exceptions though, when the nature of the relationship or trade use implies it is allowed. 
  
  For example, banks acting as agents to their customers may require a branch of a different bank to help service them in places they have no branches. If a corporation is an agent, it can only perform through its directors and employees - sub-agents. 

  As there is only privity between the agent and the principal, if the sub-agent breaches their contract, the principal will sue the agent, who in turn sues the sub-agent for recovery.
  
  ==== Duty of Good Faith
  As part of the *fiduciary duty*, the agent must be loyal and act in the best interest of the principal, keeping their interests at the top of mind. No pocketing money or not taking better prices!

  === Duties of the Principal to the Agent
  ==== Pay them
  Can be by commission, when the agent has introduced a prospective client who is "ready, willing and able to close the deal"; or upon closing of the sale. 
  
  Pay your workers for contracts to show consideration. If there is no express term, the agent is entitled to a reasonable fee as per the industry (quantum meruit in action!)
  
  ==== Cover expenses
  There is an implied term that the principal will also reimburse all reasonable expenses when the agent *acts within the scope of their authority*. 
  
  There is no obligation to pay for unauthorized acts unless they are ratified.

  === Agent Authority
  Authority is needed for the agent to be able to exit the picture when it comes to liability. So, what is it?
  
  ==== Actual Authority
  *Actual Authority* is given *expressly* - orally or in writing in the agency agreement or subsequent documents/instructions; or is given impliedly - through implied terms, conduct, or commercial usage.

  ==== Apparent/Ostensible Authority
  *Apparent Authority* is the authority a third party is entitled to assume the agent they are dealing with possesses. The authority is not real, but can be obtained through:
  #block(inset:(left:1em))[
    - Past manner of transacting business or trade custom: the third party maybe isn't aware the agent's agency no longer exists or does not apply here; or isn't aware they don't do things a specific way.
    - *Holding out*: representing by words or conduct that a person is an agent of yours, or has particular authority. So the principal cannot deny liability in this case.
  ]

  The test for Apparent Authority is "Should a reasonable third party have been aware of the agent's lack of authority, or at least been thought it was _sus_? Or, barring that, is it reasonable to assume the agency had the authority, given the business they are engaged in?". 

  If an agent has apparent authority, the principal is *still bound by the contract* even if they don't have actual authority. (In which the principal will sue the agent). Barring that, as a third party, make sure to do your due diligence on an agent's authority before doing business!

  === Rights and Liabilities of the Principal and Agent to the Third Part
  ==== When the Principal is Alone Liable
  This happens when the relationship is functional. The agent acts with real or apparent authority, and the agent makes it clear they act for a principal (even if they did not disclose the exact identity of the principal!). If both of the above occur, the agent is no longer liable.
  
  The principal becomes liable for payment and delivery *to the 3rd party* and not just their agent - if the agent, acting as deliverer, elopes with the money or goods, the principal remains liable to the 3rd party (and should sue the agent, presumably)

  ==== When the Agent is Alone Liable
  If the agent represents themselves to be the principal (either failing to ratify or forgetting to mention they are an agent), they are fully liable and the principal has no rights or liabilities under the contract.
  
  ==== When either could be Liable
  If the third party figures out that the principal-agent relationship exists, and the agent didn't make it apparent they were an agent, the third party can choose to sue either the agent or principal, but not both. If the principal is not known at that point only the agent can really be sued.

  If the agent is successfully sued, the principal will have no liability. If the existence of a principal becomes clear during trial, the third party can choose to discontinue the action against the agent and instead go after the principal.

  === Rights of the Undisclosed Principal
  An undisclosed principal has the right to enforce the contract when they can show the contract was made with their authority, and the authority was *real and not apparent* - if it was with apparent authority, they cannot ratify and enforce the contract at all.
  
  There is also an exception that undisclosed principals cannot enforce contracts that are "essentially personal in nature".

  === Tort Liabilities
  If an agent commits a tort, *both are jointly liable*. This is vicarious liability just like an employee or independent contractor.

  For example, if an agent commits fraudulent misrepresentation (aka deceit), the 3rd party has the right to rescind the contract and sue both principal and agent. The principal has the right against the agent for the deceit, and the agent can also be held liable for the fraudulent misrepresentation.

  === Breach of Warranty of Authority
  This is a *tort* - where a person falsely represents that they had the authority to contract on behalf of the principal. This can be innocent (when the principal went bankrupt, died, or lost capacity) or fradulent. The third party can bring an action against the agent for this tort to try to return all parties to the position they would be in if the misrepresentation did not occur.

  The third party can sue for breach of warranty of authority when the agent had no real or apparent authority, as well as no ratification. *No contracts are formed* between the third party and the principal (due to lack of capacity) nor the agent (as that's how agency works), which is why this tort exists. The third party will also have an action of deceit against a fraudulent agent; and an action in negligent misrepresentation where the agent negligently misrepresents their authority. 

  === Termination of an Agency Relationship
  Termination can occur in one of the following ways:
  #block(inset:(left:1em))[
    - An end time specified in the agency contract itself
    - Completion of the project for which the agency was formed
    - Either party can give notice that they wish to terminate it and it will
    - Either the principal or agent goes insane or d i e s
    - The principal goes bankrupt
    - An event occurs that makes performance of the agency agreement impossible (frustration?)
  ]
  If no fixed time is specified, it is implied the agency agreement is terminated with one side giving reasonable notice to the other. However, if a time is set, early withdrawal is a breach of contract.

  If the relationship is terminated with the principal dying, going insane, or going bankrupt, they should bring the termination to the attention of all third parties who are likely affected, as a precaution.
